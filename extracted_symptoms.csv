Disease Name,Symptoms
Abdominal aortic aneurysm,"In most cases, an AAA causes no noticeable symptoms. However, if it becomes large, some people may develop a pain or a pulsating feeling in their abdomen (tummy) or persistent back pain.
An AAA doesn’t usually pose a serious threat to health, but there’s a risk that a larger aneurysm could burst (rupture).
A ruptured aneurysm can cause massive internal bleeding, which is usually fatal. Around 8 out of 10 people with a rupture either die before they reach hospital or don’t survive surgery.
The most common symptom of a ruptured aortic aneurysm is sudden and severe pain in the abdomen.
If you suspect that you or someone else has had a ruptured aneurysm, call 999 immediately and ask for an ambulance."
Achillies tendinopathy,"Symptoms may vary from person to person. They can appear gradually or suddenly.
People may experience:

swelling
pain that’s worse during or after moving or exercising
stiffness that’s worse in the morning or after a period of rest
tenderness to touch the affected area
mild heat
loss of movement and strength around the ankle and foot

People can have one or multiple symptoms."
Acne,
Acute cholecystitis,
Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia,"Symptoms of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia usually begin slowly before rapidly getting severe as the number of blast cells (immature white blood cells) in your blood increases.
Most of the symptoms are caused by the lack of healthy blood cells in your blood supply.
Symptoms of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia include:

pale skin
feeling tired and breathless
having repeated infections over a short space of time
unusual and frequent bleeding, such as bleeding gums or nose bleeds
high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above
night sweats
bone and joint pain
easily bruised skin
swollen lymph nodes (glands)
abdominal pain – caused by a swollen liver or spleen
unexplained weight loss 
a purple skin rash (purpura)

In some cases of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, the affected cells can spread from your bloodstream into your central nervous system. This can cause a series of neurological symptoms (related to the brain and nervous system), including:

headaches
seizures (fits)
vomiting
blurred vision
dizziness

If you or your child has some or even all of these symptoms, it is still highly unlikely that acute leukaemia is the cause.
However, see your GP as soon as possible because any condition that causes these symptoms needs to be promptly investigated and treated."
Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia: Children,
Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia: Teenagers and young adults,"Many of the symptoms of ALL are caused by having fewer than normal healthy blood cells in the body. Symptoms can include:

looking paler than usual and feeling tired – because of too few red blood cells (anaemia)
bruises – you may bruise more easily and it could take longer for bleeding to stop, if you have less blood clotting cells (platelets) than normal
infections – because there are too few mature white blood cells to fight infection
aches and pains in your bones
swollen glands (lymph nodes) in your neck, under your arm or in your groin
feeling unwell and run down
fever and sweats – you may have a high temperature without any obvious cause, such as an infection
headaches and visual disturbance

There can be other reasons you may have these symptoms. But if you are worried that you may have ALL, you should speak to your GP. They’ll examine you and refer you to a hospital if they think you need to see a specialist doctor."
Acute myeloid leukaemia,"The symptoms of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) usually develop over a few weeks, becoming more severe as the number of immature white blood cells (blast cells) in your blood increases.
Symptoms of AML can include:

pale skin
tiredness
breathlessness
a high temperature (fever)
excessive sweating
weight loss
frequent infections
unusual and frequent bleeding, such as bleeding gums or nosebleeds
easily bruised skin
flat red or purple spots on the skin (petechiae)
bone and joint pain
a feeling of fullness or discomfort in your tummy (abdomen), caused by swelling of the liver or spleen

In rare cases of AML, the affected cells can spread into the central nervous system. This can cause symptoms such as headaches, fits (seizures), vomiting, blurred vision and dizziness.
See your GP if you or your child have these symptoms. Although it’s highly unlikely that AML is the cause, these symptoms need to be investigated and treated promptly."
Acute myeloid leukaemia: Children,
Acute myeloid leukaemia: Teenagers and young adults,"Many of the symptoms of AML are caused by having fewer than normal healthy blood cells in the body. Symptoms can include:

looking paler than usual and feeling tired – because of too few red blood cells (anaemia)
bruises or bleeding – you may bruise more easily and it could take longer for bleeding to stop, if you have less blood clotting cells (platelets) than normal
infections – because there are too few mature white blood cells to fight infection
aches and pains in your bones
swollen glands (lymph nodes) in your neck, under your arm or in your groin
feeling unwell and run down
fever and sweats – you may have a high temperature without any obvious cause, such as an infection
headaches and blurred vision – because of too many white blood cells
breathlessness – because of too many white blood cells.
"
Acute pancreatitis,"The main symptom of acute pancreatitis is a severe, dull pain around the top of your stomach that develops suddenly.
This aching pain often gets steadily worse and can travel along your back or below your left shoulder blade. Eating or drinking may also make you feel worse very quickly, especially fatty foods.
Leaning forward or curling into a ball may help to relieve the pain, but lying flat on your back often increases the pain.
Acute pancreatitis caused by gallstones usually develops after eating a large meal. If the condition is caused by alcohol, the pain often develops 6 to 12 hours after drinking a significant amount of alcohol.
Other symptoms of acute pancreatitis can include:

nausea (feeling sick) or vomiting
diarrhoea
indigestion
a high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above
jaundice – yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes
tenderness or swelling of the abdomen (tummy)

Contact your GP immediately if you suddenly develop severe abdominal pain. If this isn’t possible, contact NHS 24 111 Service or your local out-of-hours service for advice."
Addison’s disease,"Addison’s disease can be difficult to detect at first, because early symptoms are similar to symptoms of many other health conditions.
Initial symptoms of Addison’s disease can include:

fatigue (lack of energy or motivation)
lethargy (abnormal drowsiness or tiredness)
muscle weakness
low mood (mild depression) or irritability
loss of appetite and unintentional weight loss
the need to urinate frequently
increased thirst
craving for salty foods

Dehydration can also be an early sign of Addison’s disease. It’s caused by lack of the hormone aldosterone in your body, which is used to regulate the balance of salt and water.
Further symptoms of Addison’s disease tend to develop gradually over months or years. However, additional stress, caused by another illness or an accident, for example, may cause your symptoms to suddenly get worse.
You may go on to develop:

low blood pressure when you stand up, which can cause dizziness and fainting 
feeling sick (nausea)
vomiting
diarrhoea
abdominal, joint or back pain
muscle cramps 
chronic exhaustion, which may cause depression
brownish discolouration of the skin, lips and gums (hyperpigmentation), particularly in the creases on your palms, on scars or on pressure points, such as your knuckles or knees
a reduced libido (lack of interest in sex), particularly in women

Some women may also have irregular periods or miss some periods completely. Children with Addison’s disease may experience puberty later than usual.
Some people with Addison’s disease also develop low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia). This can cause symptoms such as difficulty concentrating, confusion, anxiety and even unconsciousness (particularly in children).
If you’re experiencing symptoms of Addison’s disease, see your GP so they can diagnose or rule out the condition. These symptoms will usually improve with appropriate treatment.
Read more about diagnosing Addison’s disease and treating Addison’s disease
If Addison’s disease is left untreated, the levels of hormones produced by the adrenal gland gradually decrease in the body. This causes your symptoms to get progressively worse and eventually lead to a life-threatening situation called an adrenal or Addisonian crisis.
During an adrenal crisis, the symptoms of Addison’s disease appear quickly and severely. This could happen when you’re already experiencing initial symptoms or without any symptoms at all.
Signs of an adrenal crisis include:

severe dehydration
pale, cold, clammy skin
sweating
rapid, shallow breathing
dizziness
severe vomiting and diarrhoea
severe muscle weakness
headache
severe drowsiness or loss of consciousness

An adrenal crisis is a medical emergency. If left untreated, it can be fatal. If you think you or someone you know with Addison’s disease is having an adrenal crisis, phone 999 for an ambulance.
If an adrenal crisis isn’t treated, it can lead to a coma and death. There’s also a risk your brain won’t get enough oxygen if treatment is delayed, which can cause permanent disability."
Adenomyosis,"It’s possible to have adenomyosis and have no symptoms. Symptoms you might experience include:

heavy periods that last for a long time
severe period pain
a feeling of pressure in your tummy
bloating (your tummy sticks out more than normal)
"
Alcohol-related liver disease,"In many cases, people with alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD) don’t have any noticeable symptoms until their liver is badly damaged.
If you do experience early symptoms of ARLD, these are often quite vague, such as:

abdominal pain
loss of appetite
fatigue
feeling sick
diarrhoea
feeling generally unwell

As the liver becomes more severely damaged, more obvious and serious symptoms can develop, such as:

yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice)
swelling in the legs, ankles and feet, due to a build-up of fluid (oedema)
swelling in your abdomen, due to a build-up of fluid known as ascites
a high temperature (fever) and shivering attacks
very itchy skin
hair loss
unusually curved fingertips and nails (clubbed fingers)
blotchy red palms
significant weight loss
weakness and muscle wasting
confusion and memory problems, trouble sleeping (insomnia) and changes in your personality due to a build-up of toxins in the brain
vomiting blood and black, tarry stools due to internal bleeding
a tendency to bleed and bruise more easily, such as frequent nosebleeds and bleeding gums
increased sensitivity to alcohol and drugs (because the liver can’t process them)

ARLD doesn’t often cause symptoms until it’s reached an advanced stage. If you misuse alcohol, you may have liver damage, even though you have none of these symptoms.
Read about alcohol misuse (drinking too much). 
Contact your GP for advice if you have a history of regular alcohol misuse.
A good way to assess your history and pattern of drinking is to use a short test known as the CAGE test, which consists of 4 questions:

Have you ever thought you should cut down on your drinking?
Have people annoyed you by criticising your drinking?
Have you ever felt guilty about your drinking?
Have you ever drunk an ‘eye-opener’, which means: have you ever drunk alcohol first thing in the morning to get over a hangover and steady your nerves?

If you answer yes to 1 or more of the questions, you may have an alcohol problem and are advised to see your GP.
See your GP as soon as possible if you have symptoms of advanced ARLD.
Read more about how ARLD is diagnosed."
Allergic rhinitis,"Allergic rhinitis usually causes cold-like symptoms, such as:

sneezing
itchiness
a blocked or runny nose

These symptoms usually start soon after coming into contact with something you’re allergic to.
Some people only get allergic rhinitis seasonally because they’re allergic to things like tree or grass pollen. Other people get allergic rhinitis all year round.
Your GP will usually be able to diagnose allergic rhinitis from your symptoms and any triggers you may have noticed. If the cause of your condition is uncertain, you may be referred for allergy testing.
Treatment for allergic rhinitis depends on how severe your symptoms are.
If you have mild allergic rhinitis, you can often treat the symptoms yourself.
Always read the leaflet that comes with your medicine before taking it. Follow the recommended dosage instructions. If you’re not sure which treatments are suitable for you or your child, speak to a pharmacist for advice.
Medication won’t cure your allergy, but it can be used to treat the symptoms.
Speak to your GP practice if your symptoms do not improve 2 weeks after starting medicine. They may prescribe a stronger medication such as a nasal spray containing corticosteroids.
Allergic rhinitis is caused by breathing in tiny particles that you’re allergic to. The most common allergens in the air that cause rhinitis are:

house dust mites
pollen and spores
flakes of animal skin
wood dust
flour dust
latex

You’re more likely to develop an allergy if there’s a history of allergies in your family.
Allergic rhinitis can lead to complications in some cases. These include:

nasal polyps – abnormal but non-cancerous (benign) growths inside the nose and sinuses
sinusitis – inflammation that blocks the sinuses so mucus cannot drain into your nose as usual
blockage of the middle ear – due to a build-up of fluid behind the eardrum

These problems can often be treated with medication. Surgery is sometimes needed in severe or long-term cases."
Allergies,"Symptoms of an allergic reaction usually develop within a few minutes of being exposed to something you’re allergic to, although occasionally they can develop gradually over a few hours.
Although allergic reactions can be a nuisance and hamper your normal activities, most are mild. Very occasionally, a severe reaction called anaphylaxis can occur.
Common symptoms of an allergic reaction include:

sneezing and an itchy, runny or blocked nose (allergic rhinitis)
itchy, red, watering eyes (conjunctivitis)
wheezing, chest tightness, shortness of breath and a cough
a raised, itchy, red rash (hives)
swollen lips, tongue, eyes or face
tummy pain, feeling sick, vomiting or diarrhoea
dry, red and cracked skin

The symptoms vary depending on what you’re allergic to and how you come into contact with it. For example, you may have a runny nose if exposed to pollen, develop a rash if you have a skin allergy, or feel sick if you eat something you’re allergic to.
See your pharmacist if you or your child might have had an allergic reaction to something. They can help determine whether the symptoms are caused by an allergy or another condition. Read more about diagnosing allergies.
In rare cases, an allergy can lead to a severe allergic reaction, called anaphylaxis or anaphylactic shock, which can be life-threatening.
This affects the whole body and usually develops within minutes of exposure to something you’re allergic to.
Signs of anaphylaxis include any of the symptoms above, as well as:

swelling of the throat and mouth
difficulty breathing
lightheadedness
confusion
blue skin or lips
collapsing and losing consciousness

Anaphylaxis is a medical emergency that requires immediate treatment. Read more about anaphylaxis for information about what to do if it occurs."
Alzheimer’s disease,"Alzheimer’s disease is a progressive condition. This means the symptoms develop gradually and become more severe over time.
The first sign of Alzheimer’s disease is usually minor memory problems. For example, a loss of interest and enjoyment in day-to-day activities. It’s also common to forget about recent conversations, events or the names of places.
As the condition develops, memory problems become more severe.
Other changes caused by Alzheimer’s disease that could cause you concern include:

confusion, disorientation and getting lost in familiar places
difficulty planning or making decisions
problems with speech and language
problems moving around without help
difficulty performing self-care tasks
stress and distress
hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that aren’t there)
delusions (believing things that are untrue)
low mood or anxiety
"
Anal cancer,"The symptoms of anal cancer are often similar to more common and less serious conditions affecting the anus, such as piles (haemorrhoids) and anal fissures (small tears or sores).
Symptoms of anal cancer can include:

bleeding from the bottom (rectal bleeding)
itching and pain around the anus
small lumps around the anus
a discharge of mucus from the anus
loss of bowel control (bowel incontinence)

However, some people with anal cancer don’t have any symptoms. 
Speak to your GP if you develop any of the above symptoms. While they’re unlikely to be caused by anal cancer, it’s best to get them checked out.
Your GP will usually ask about your symptoms and carry out some examinations.
They may feel your tummy and carry out a rectal examination. This involves your doctor inserting a gloved finger into your bottom so they can feel any abnormalities. Your GP will refer you to hospital if they think further tests are necessary. 
The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends in its 2015 guidelines that GPs should consider referring someone with an unexplained anal lump or anal ulcer. The person should receive an appointment within 2 weeks.
If you’re referred to hospital, a number of different tests may be carried out to check for anal cancer and rule out other conditions.
Some of the tests you may have include a:

sigmoidoscopy – where a thin, flexible tube with a small camera and light is inserted into your bottom to check for any abnormalities
proctoscopy – where the inside of your rectum is examined using a hollow tube-like instrument (proctoscope) with a light on the end
biopsy – where a small tissue sample is removed from your anus during a sigmoidoscopy or proctoscopy so it can be examined in a laboratory under a microscope 

If these tests suggest you have anal cancer, you may have some scans to check whether the cancer has spread. Once these are complete, your doctors will be able to ‘stage’ the cancer. This means giving it a score to describe how large it is and how far it has spread.
You can read more about the stages of anal cancer on the Cancer Research UK website.
If you’re diagnosed with anal cancer, you’ll be cared for by a multidisciplinary team. This is a team of different specialists who work together to provide the best treatment and care.
The main treatments used for anal cancer are:

chemoradiation – a combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy
surgery – to remove a tumour or a larger section of bowel

In cases where the cancer has spread and can’t be cured, chemotherapy alone may be considered to help relieve symptoms. This is known as palliative care.
Chemoradiation is a treatment that combines chemotherapy (cancer-killing medication) and radiotherapy (where radiation is used to kill cancer cells). It’s currently the most effective treatment for anal cancer. You don’t usually need to stay in hospital when you’re having chemoradiation.
Chemotherapy for anal cancer is usually given in 2 cycles, each lasting 4 to 5 days, with a 4-week gap between the cycles. In many cases, part of the chemotherapy is delivered through a small tube called a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) in your arm, which can stay in place until your treatment has finished.
The tube means you don’t need to stay in hospital during each of the cycles of chemotherapy. However, you’ll be attached to a small plastic pump, which you take home with you.
A few hospitals now offer tablet chemotherapy for anal cancer, which avoids the need for the pump and PICC.
Read more about how chemotherapy is carried out
Radiotherapy is usually given in short sessions, once a day from Monday to Friday, with a break at weekends. This is usually carried out for 5 to 6 weeks. To prepare for radiotherapy, additional scans will be required.
Read more about how radiotherapy is carried out
Both chemotherapy and radiotherapy often cause significant side effects, including:

tiredness
sore skin around the anus
sore skin around the penis and scrotum in men or vulva in women
hair loss – limited hair loss from the head, but total loss from the pubic area
feeling sick
diarrhoea

These side effects are usually temporary, but there’s also a risk of longer-term problems, such as infertility. If you’re concerned about the potential side effects of treatment, you should discuss this with your care team before treatment begins. 
Other possible long-term side effects can include:

bowel control problems
long-term (chronic) diarrhoea
erectile dysfunction
vaginal pain when having sex
dry and itchy skin around the groin and anus
bleeding from the anus, rectum, vagina or bladder

Tell your doctor if you develop any of these symptoms so they can be investigated and treated.
Surgery is a less common treatment option for anal cancer. It’s usually only considered if the tumour is small and can be easily removed, or if chemoradiation hasn’t worked.
If the tumour is very small and clearly defined, it may be cut out during a procedure called a local excision. This is a relatively simple procedure, carried out under general anaesthetic, that usually only requires a stay in hospital of a few days.
If chemoradiation has been unsuccessful or the cancer has returned after treatment, a more complex operation called an abdominoperineal resection may be recommended. As with a local excision, this operation is carried out under general anaesthetic.
An abdominoperineal resection involves removing your anus, rectum, part of the colon, some surrounding muscle tissue, and sometimes some of the surrounding lymph nodes (small glands that form part of the immune system) to reduce the risk of the cancer returning. You’ll usually need to stay in hospital for up to 10 days after this type of surgery.
During the operation, a permanent colostomy will also be formed to allow you to pass stools. This is where a section of the large intestine is diverted through an opening made in the abdomen called a stoma. The stoma is attached to a special pouch that will collect your stools after the operation.
Before and after the operation, you’ll see a specialist nurse who can offer support and advice to help you adapt to life with a colostomy. Adjusting to life with a colostomy can be challenging, but most people become accustomed to it over time.
Read more about living with a colostomy
After your course of treatment ends, you’ll need to have regular follow-up appointments to monitor your recovery and check for any signs of the cancer returning.
To start with, these appointments will be every few weeks or months, but they’ll gradually become less frequent over time.
The exact cause of anal cancer is unknown, although a number of factors can increase your risk of developing the condition. These include:

infection with human papilloma virus (HPV) – a common and usually harmless group of viruses spread through sexual contact, which can affect the moist membranes lining your body
having anal sex or lots of sexual partners – possibly because this increases your risk of developing HPV
having a history of cervical, vaginal or vulval cancer
smoking
having a weakened immune system – for example, if you have HIV

Your risk of developing anal cancer increases as you get older, with half of all cases diagnosed in people aged 65 or over. The condition is also slightly more common in women than men.

"
Anaphylaxis,
Angina,"The main symptom of angina is chest pain. This can:

feel like a dull pain, ache, ‘heavy’ or ‘tight’ feeling in your chest
spread to your arms, neck, jaw or back
be triggered by physical exertion

Angina itself is not life threatening, but prolonged chest pain can be a symptom of a heart attack.
To diagnose angina, you will be assessed and you may need to have several tests.
You will also be asked some questions about:

the symptoms you experienced
if there were any triggers for the pain
your family’s medical history
lifestyle risk factors (like smoking, for example)

You might also be given some tests to determine if you already have heart disease or you’re at risk of it.

measuring your weight
measuring blood pressure
taking blood to check cholesterol levels, diabetes or anaemia

If it’s thought that you have angina, you might be referred to the hospital for some more tests. These might include:

electrocardiogram (ECG) – measures the rhythms and electrical activity of the heart
exercise tolerance test (ETT) – measures the activity of the heart during exercise
myocardial perfusion scan (MPS or MYoview) – measures how well blood is reaching the heart
coronary angiography – shows whether your coronary arteries are narrow and how severe any blockages are
blood tests – help to identify increased enzyme levels (troponin) which are released when the heart is damaged

The 2 main types of angina are stable angina and unstable angina.
Stable angina is more common. Attacks are more likely to have a trigger (like physical activity or stress).
Symptoms of stable angina usually only last for a few minutes after exercise or stress. They can improve with rest and by taking a medication called Glyceryl trinitrate (GTN).
Attacks of unstable angina can be unpredictable and develop without any clear triggers. They might also last longer and continue even when resting.
Sometimes, when chest pain occurs suddenly, it’s unclear if it’s due to unstable angina or a heart attack. Until tests confirm the diagnosis, doctors sometimes call this Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS)."
Angioedema,"The main sign of angioedema is swelling that develops below the skin’s surface.
The swelling is caused by a collection of fluid in the deep layers of the skin.
It most often affects the hands, feet, eyes, lips, or genitals. In severe cases, the inside lining of the throat and bowel can be affected (see below).
The swelling usually appears suddenly, and is more severe than normal hives (nettle rash). It commonly lasts 1 to 3 days. There may be a prickling sensation in the affected area before swelling is visible.
The swelling is not itchy and the skin may look a normal colour; however, many people with allergic or idiopathic angioedema also develop urticaria (hives), which is red and itchy.
As well as visible swellings, angioedema can cause other symptoms, including:

a hot or painful sensation in the swollen areas
swelling of the inside of the throat, the windpipe and the tongue, making breathing difficult
swelling of the conjunctiva (the transparent layer of cells that cover the white part of the eye), which affects vision

People with hereditary angioedema may also experience:

abdominal (stomach) pain caused by swelling in the stomach and bowel, which can cause nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea
swelling of the bladder or urethra (the tube that connects the bladder to the genitals), which can cause bladder problems and difficulty passing urine

Contact your GP if you have an episode of angioedema that does not affect your breathing and you have not previously been diagnosed with the condition. You will need to have tests to determine what type of angioedema you have.
Dial 999 to request an ambulance if you suspect that you, or someone you know, is experiencing anaphylaxis (a severe allergic reaction). Tell the operator that you suspect anaphylaxis.
Initial symptoms of anaphylaxis include:

a feeling of tightness in the chest that leads to breathing problems 
swelling of the tongue and throat

If you, or the person in your care, has previously been prescribed an adrenaline auto-injector pen, you should use it while waiting for the ambulance to arrive."
Ankle sprain,"These vary from person to person and some symptoms may appear several days after the initial injury.
People may experience: 

swelling and bruising
pain
mild heat and redness.
loss of movement and strength around the ankle and foot
difficulty walking or going up or down stairs
tingling, numbness or pins and needles in the affected area
"
Ankylosing spondylitis,"The symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis (AS) can vary from person to person, but usually develop slowly, over several months or years.
AS usually first starts to develop during later teenage years or early adulthood. The symptoms may come and go, and improve or get worse over many years.
The main symptoms of AS are described below, although you may not develop all of these if you have the condition. 
Back pain and stiffness are usually the main symptoms of AS. You may find:

the pain gets better with exercise but doesn’t improve, or gets worse, with rest
the pain and stiffness is worse in the morning and at night – you may wake up regularly during the night because of the pain
you have pain in the area around your buttocks

As well as causing symptoms in your back and spine, AS can also cause inflammation of the joints (arthritis) in other parts of your body, such as your hips and knees. The main symptoms associated with arthritis are:

pain on moving the affected joint
tenderness when the affected joint is examined
swelling and warmth in the affected area  

Enthesitis is painful inflammation where a bone is joined to a tendon (a tough cord of tissue that connects muscles to bones) or a ligament (a band of tissue that connects bones to bones).
Common sites for enthesitis are:

at the top of the shin bone
behind the heel (Achilles tendon)
under the heel
where the ribs join to the breast bone

If your ribs are affected, you may experience chest pain, and you may find it difficult to expand your chest when breathing deeply.
Fatigue is a common symptom of untreated AS. It can make you feel tired and lacking in energy.
You should see your GP if you have persistent symptoms of AS.
If your GP thinks you may have the condition, they should refer you to a rheumatologist (a specialist in conditions affecting muscles and joints) for further tests and any necessary treatment.
Read more about diagnosing ankylosing spondylitis."
Anorexia nervosa,"Signs and symptoms of anorexia include:

fear of ‘being fat’ or gaining weight
problems with self-esteem and body image when it comes to food and weight
restricting food intake
keeping your body weight low, to the point it’s unhealthy

Restricting your food intake means your body isn’t getting enough energy or nutrition. This can lead to other physical symptoms.
Eating too little for a long time can cause physical symptoms, like:

fine downy hair (lanugo) growing on the body
more hair on the face
pubic hair becoming sparse and thin
slow or irregular heartbeat

People with anorexia may also:

have pain in their abdomen (tummy)
feel bloated or constipated
have swelling in their feet, hands or face
feel very tired
have low blood pressure (hypotension)
feel cold or have a low body temperature
feel light-headed or dizzy

In children with anorexia, puberty and the associated growth spurt may be delayed. They may gain less weight than expected for someone going through puberty. They might be shorter than other people of the same age.
If you get periods and you have anorexia, your periods may stop. Anorexia can also lead to infertility, for both men and women.
Beat has more information about treatment for anorexia
If someone close to you is showing signs of anorexia, you can offer help and support.
You could try talking to them about how they feel, and encourage them to think about getting help. Try not to put pressure on them or be critical of them, as this could make things worse. You could also offer to help by going with the person to see their GP.
If you’d like to get some advice on how to help, a healthcare professional, such as your own GP, can provide information on:

how to help the person recognise that they have a problem
the treatments available
how you can support them during their treatment

You could also get help from a support group for people who have loved ones with eating disorders.
Beat has more information about how to support someone with anorexia
When making a diagnosis, your GP will probably ask questions about your weight and eating habits.
For example, they might:

ask if you’ve lost a lot of weight recently or quite quickly
ask how you feel about your weight, and if you’re concerned about it
ask if you make yourself vomit regularly
check if you have periods, whether your periods have stopped and if so, for how long
check your weight
check your pulse and blood pressure
do a blood test

It’s important to answer these questions honestly. Your GP isn’t trying to judge you. They just need to accurately assess your symptoms.
If your GP thinks you may have anorexia, they’ll refer you to a specialist in eating disorders for a more detailed assessment. Your GP sometimes carries out this assessment.
Treatment for anorexia usually involves a combination of:

talking therapy, and
supervised weight gain

It’s important to start treatment as early as possible to reduce the risk of serious complications.
Treatment for anorexia is slightly different for adults and those under 18 years old.
If someone has anorexia for a long time, it can lead to severe complications and health problems. These can sometimes be permanent.
People with anorexia have an increased risk of:

poor circulation and cardiovascular problems
heart conditions, like coronary heart disease and irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia)
health problems caused by malnutrition – a lack of vitamins and minerals

Anorexia can cause an imbalance of minerals in the blood, like potassium, calcium and sodium. These minerals help keep you healthy. When there’s an imbalance, it can cause symptoms like:

tiredness
weakness
dehydration
fits
irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia)
muscle spasms
confusion

Other conditions that can be caused by anorexia and malnutrition can include:

low blood pressure (hypotension)
anaemia
dental problems, like tooth decay caused by regular vomiting
low blood sugar levels (hypoglycaemia)
acute kidney (renal) failure
liver damage
heart failure
osteoporosis (fragile bones) and loss of muscle strength, particularly in women and girls
loss of sex drive (libido) and impotency in men

Misuse of laxatives can damage the bowels and cause permanent constipation.
Anorexia can lead to irregular menstrual cycles (periods), or cause your periods to stop altogether. This doesn’t mean anorexia makes you infertile.
If you have anorexia, even if your periods are irregular or have stopped, you should continue to use birth control if you aren’t planning a pregnancy.
If you have anorexia and are trying to become pregnant, you should discuss this with your GP and care team.
Anorexia during pregnancy can increase the risk of complications, like:

miscarriage
giving birth early (premature birth)
having a baby with a low birth weight

You’re also likely to need extra care and support during pregnancy if you have previously had anorexia and recovered from it."
Anxiety,"GAD can cause a change in your behaviour and the way you think and feel about things. It can also cause physical changes. This results in symptoms like:

restlessness
a sense of dread
feeling constantly “on edge”
difficulty concentrating
irritability
dizziness
tiredness
a noticeably strong, fast or irregular heartbeat (palpitations)
muscle aches and tension
trembling or shaking
dry mouth
excessive sweating
shortness of breath
stomach ache
feeling sick
headache
pins and needles
difficulty falling or staying asleep (insomnia)

Your symptoms may cause you to withdraw from social contact to avoid feelings of worry and dread.
You may also find going to work difficult and stressful and may take time off sick. These actions can make you worry even more about yourself and increase your lack of self-esteem.
If you’re anxious as a result of a specific phobia or because of panic disorder, you’ll usually know what the cause is. For example, if you have claustrophobia (a fear of enclosed spaces), you know that being confined in a small space will trigger your anxiety.
However, if you have GAD, it may not always be clear what you’re feeling anxious about. Not knowing what triggers your anxiety can intensify it. You may start to worry that there’ll be no solution."
Anxiety disorders in children,
Appendicitis,"Appendicitis typically starts with a pain in the middle of your tummy (abdomen) that may come and go.
Within hours, the pain travels to your lower right-hand side, where the appendix is usually located, and becomes constant and severe.
Pressing on this area, coughing, or walking may all make the pain worse.
If you have appendicitis, you may also have other symptoms, including:

feeling sick (nausea)
being sick
loss of appetite
diarrhoea
a high temperature (fever) and a flushed face

If you’re experiencing abdominal pain that’s gradually getting worse, contact your GP or local out-of-hours service immediately. If these options aren’t available, phone NHS 24 111 Service for advice.
Appendicitis can easily be confused with something else, such as:

gastroenteritis
severe irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)
constipation
bladder or urine infections
Crohn’s disease
pelvic infection

In young women, these symptoms can sometimes have a gynaecological cause, such as an ectopic pregnancy or menstrual pain.
However, any condition that causes constant stomach pain requires urgent medical attention.
You should phone 999 for an ambulance if you get a pain that suddenly becomes worse and spreads across your abdomen. These are signs your appendix may have burst.
If the appendix bursts, it can cause peritonitis, a potentially serious infection of the inner lining of the abdomen.
Read more about the complications of appendicitis."
Arterial thrombosis,"Depending on where the clot is in your body, a bloodclot in an artery (arterial thrombosis) can cause:

angina
heart attack
stroke
peripheral vascular disease

Find out about each of these below.
A heart attack can happen when a blood clot completely blocks an artery that pumps blood to your heart muscle.
You may experience:

a crushing central chest pain or mild chest discomfort
shortness of breath
a clammy, sweaty and grey complexion
dizziness
nausea and vomiting

If you suspect you or someone you know is having a heart attack, dial 999 immediately. It’s important that you don’t wait and do treat these symptoms as an emergency.
Find out more about the symptoms of a heart attack
Arterial thrombosis can cause a stroke if a blood clot is blocking an artery that supplies blood to your brain.
The symptoms of a stroke can come on suddenly and may include:

numbness or weakness down one side, ranging in severity from weakness in your hand to complete paralysis of the whole side of your body
weakness in your face, which can make you drool saliva
dizziness
difficulty talking and understanding what others are saying
problems with balance and co-ordination
difficulty swallowing

If you suspect that you or someone else is having a stroke, dial 999 immediately. It’s important that you don’t wait and do treat these symptoms as an emergency.
If you have a narrowing of an artery in one or both of your legs (peripheral vascular disease) you may:

be more susceptible to developing a clot
have pain when exercising, usually in the lower half of your legs
have pain that may affect both legs, but develops in one leg before the other
have pale, cold skin and numbness in one of your legs

Peripheral vascular disease can also cause other problems such as impotence (erectile dysfunction).
If you have any of these symptoms, it’s important to talk to your GP.
If one of your legs is a very different colour from the other, and you have other symptoms, you should treat this as an emergency and call 999."
Arthritis,"Your symptoms will vary depending on the type of arthritis you have.
There’s no cure for arthritis, but there are many treatments that can help manage the condition.
The best treatment for you will depend on what type of arthritis you have. Often, you will need a combination of treatments to help manage arthritis.
Some common treatments for arthritis include:

painkillers
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
corticosteroids
disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs)
physiotherapy
regular exercise

In severe cases, surgery may be recommended. This includes:

joint replacement
joint fusion
osteotomy (where a bone is cut and re-aligned)

Further information on treatments for arthritis from Versus Arthritis
An Occupational Therapist can help if you have severe arthritis that affects your:

ability to move around your home
carry out everyday tasks, like cooking and cleaning

They can tell you about equipment you may need to help you live independently.
Depending on the type of arthritis, your GP may be able to refer you to an NHS Occupational Therapist.
Further information on Occupational Therapy
If you have arthritis, it’s important to look after your joints to prevent more damage.
If you have arthritis, carrying out tasks around the home can be a challenge. But, making some practical changes to your home and changing the way you work should make things easier.
Living with arthritis isn’t easy. Carrying out simple, everyday tasks can often be painful and difficult. But, there are many things you can do to make sure you live a healthy lifestyle.
Many people with arthritis want to continue to work for many reasons. For example, for better financial security and higher self-esteem.
You may find work challenging, but your employer should help you get the training and support you need. Speak to your line manager or HR department about your condition to get the right support.
Treatment can also help you return to work after being diagnosed with arthritis.
If your arthritis is so severe that you’re unable to work, help is available. For example, the Personal Independence Payment.
Further information on work and arthritis from Versus Arthritis
It’s very important to eat a healthy, balanced diet if you have arthritis. Eating healthily will give you all the nutrients you need and help you maintain a healthy weight.
Your diet should include a variety of foods from all 5 food groups. These are:

fruit and vegetables
starchy foods – like bread, rice, potatoes and pasta
meat, fish, eggs and beans
milk and dairy foods
foods containing fat and sugar

Further information on a healthy, balanced diet
If you’re overweight, losing weight can help you cope with arthritis.
Too much weight places excess pressure on the joints in your hips, knees, ankles and feet. This can lead to more pain and mobility problems.
Further information on managing your weight
If your arthritis is painful, you may not feel like exercising. But, being active can help reduce and prevent pain.
Alongside a healthy diet, regular exercise can help you lose weight which will place less strain on your joints.
Regular exercise can also:

improve the range of movement in your joints
improve joint mobility
increase muscle strength
reduce stiffness
boost your energy

As long as you do the right type and level of exercise for your condition, your arthritis won’t get any worse. Speak to your GP for advice about the type and level of exercise that’s right for you.

"
Asbestosis,
Asthma,"Symptoms include:

coughing
wheezing
chest tightness
breathlessness

Symptoms can vary from person to person. They’re often worse at night and early in the morning, or with certain triggers.
Asthma is well controlled in most people most of the time. It shouldn’t restrict your daily life (including your sleep) in any way. You should work with your healthcare professionals to help control your asthma.

Take 1 to 2 puffs of your reliever inhaler (usually blue) immediately. Use a spacer if you have one. If it is 2 puffs, these should be 1 at a time.
Sit down and try to take slow, steady breaths.
If you do not start to feel better, take 1 puff of your reliever inhaler every 1 minute. You can take up to 10 puffs. This is easier using a spacer if you have one.
If you do not feel better after taking your inhaler or if you’re worried, phone 999.
If an ambulance does not arrive within 10 minutes and you’re still feeling unwell, repeat step 3.

Your inhaler could be empty. Change to another inhaler if you can to check if it helps.
If your symptoms improve and you do not need to phone 999, you still need to see a doctor or asthma nurse within 24 hours.
If you have symptoms of asthma, your GP may ask you:

when your symptoms happen
how often you get symptoms
if you have noticed any triggers
if you have eczema or hay fever

Tests you may be offered include:

spirometry – where you breathe into a machine to check how well your lungs work
peak expiratory flow test – uses a small hand-held device to measure how fast you can blow air out of your lungs in one breath
airways responsiveness – measures how your airways react when they come into contact with a trigger
testing airway inflammation – either with a mucus sample or measuring your nitric oxide concentration (a high level can be a sign of airway inflammation)
allergy tests – to check if your asthma is linked to allergies like dust mites, pollen, or food

There is no cure for asthma but there are treatments that can help:

prevent future symptoms and attacks
relieve your symptoms

Most people will take medications once or twice daily, usually using an inhaler. Your nurse, doctor or pharmacist will teach you how to properly use your inhaler.
Watch Asthma + Lung UK’s videos on how to use your inhaler
Finding and avoiding your possible triggers is also important.
Some treatments may have side effects.
If you’re diagnosed with asthma, your healthcare professional will agree a personal asthma action plan with you. This could include information like:

the medicines you need to take
how to recognise when your symptoms are getting worse
what to do if your symptoms get worse

Your personal asthma action plan should be reviewed with your nurse, doctor or pharmacist at least once a year. If your symptoms are severe, it can be reviewed more regularly.
Reliever inhalers – usually blue – help asthma symptoms quickly, usually within 3 to 5 minutes. They widen your airways, making it easier to breathe again. It’s a short-lived medication and will last for around 4 hours.
Everyone with asthma should be given a reliever inhaler which may be blue or may be a combination inhaler that you usually use for maintenance treatment. If your asthma is well controlled, you should rarely need to use an extra reliever.
Preventer inhalers work over time to reduce the inflammation and sensitivity of your airways. They reduce the chances of asthma attacks. They must be used regularly (usually twice a day) to keep asthma under control.
It can take a while for your preventer inhaler to work fully. You may still occasionally need the blue reliever inhaler.
If you smoke, preventer inhalers may not work as well for you.
If using reliever and preventer inhalers does not control your asthma, you may need an inhaler that combines both.
Combination inhalers are used every day to help stop symptoms occurring and provide long-lasting relief if they do occur. Some combination inhalers can also be used as relievers as well as being your usual preventer treatment. This is referred to as MART (Maintenance and reliver Treatment) or AIR (Anti-inflammatory reliever) treatment.
It’s important to use it regularly, even if you do not have symptoms.
There is no recycling scheme available for used inhalers. You should return all your used or expired inhalers to your community pharmacy for safe disposal. Spacers should be replaced each year if used regularly. Old spacers go into the household bin.
If your asthma isn’t controlled by using inhalers alone, you may be prescribed:

Montelukast – tablets that block part of the chemical reaction involved in the swelling (inflammation) of the airways
theophyllines – tablets that help widen the airways by relaxing the muscles around them, and are also relatively weak anti-inflammatory agents
biological treatments

If your asthma is still not under control, you may be prescribed a short course of oral steroid tablets or, more rarely, regular steroid tablets. This treatment should be monitored by a hospital asthma specialist.
Long-term use of oral steroids has serious possible side effects, so they’re only used once other treatments have been tried. Your healthcare professional should talk about the risks and benefits with you. You should be given a steroid treatment card by your healthcare professional.
Breathing exercises can improve symptoms and reduce the need for reliever medicines in some people. These include breathing exercises taught by a physiotherapist and yoga.
Breathing and relaxation exercises
It’s not clear exactly what causes asthma. It’s likely to be a combination of factors.
You’ve a higher chance of having asthma if you have:

an allergy such as eczema, allergic rhinitis, food allergy or hay fever
a family history of asthma or other similar conditions
bronchiolitis (a common childhood lung infection) as a child
childhood exposure to tobacco smoke, particularly if your mother also smoked during pregnancy
been born prematurely, especially if you needed a ventilator to support your breathing after birth
a low birth weight as a result of restricted growth within the womb

Some people may also be at risk of developing asthma through their job.
An asthma trigger is something that irritates your lungs. When you come into contact with a trigger your airways narrow, the muscles around them tighten, and you make more sticky mucus (phlegm).
Common asthma triggers include:

infections in the upper airways like colds and the flu
dust mites
animal fur
feathers
pollen
cigarette smoke
chemical fumes
pollution
exercise
mould or damp
emotions – including stress or laughing
food allergies
certain weather
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), like aspirin and ibuprofen
beta-blockers sometimes given for high blood pressure or some types of heart disease
foods containing sulphites – such as concentrated fruit juice, jam, prawns and many processed or pre-cooked meals

Asthma may also be triggered by allergens or chemicals breathed in at work. Speak to your GP if you think your symptoms are worse at work and get better on holiday.
You may be able to help your symptoms by avoiding your asthma triggers.
Speak to your nurse, doctor or pharmacist if you have asthma symptoms during or after exercise. They may review your asthma plan to make sure your symptoms are under control.
They may also advise that you:

make sure the people you’re exercising with know you have asthma
increase your fitness levels slowly
always have your reliever inhaler (usually blue) with you when you exercise
always warm up and cool down

If you have symptoms while you’re exercising, stop, take your reliever inhaler, and wait until you feel better before starting again.
Read further information about keeping active
Hormones can change asthma symptoms. For example, around the time of your period, during menopause, and during pregnancy. You should continue to manage your asthma in the same way.
Make sure your asthma is well controlled during pregnancy.
Most medicines used for asthma are safe to take during pregnancy and when breastfeeding. You should not take leukotriene receptor antagonists if you’re pregnant, unless advised to by a healthcare professional."
Ataxia,"People with ataxia often find they’re falling over more or can’t walk in a straight line.
Other symptoms can include:

becoming more clumsy
slurred speech
problems with swallowing which can cause choking or coughing
tremors or shaking
fatigue or tiredness
problems with sight like blurred or jumpy vision caused by difficulty controlling eye movements

Some people experience mild symptoms like slight balance problems. Other people have more severe symptoms and need help to carry out everyday tasks.
Some types of ataxia are inherited. This means they’re caused by genes passed on by a parent (or parents) to their child. Other types of ataxia that are not inherited can be caused by different factors like brain damage, diet, or side effects from taking drugs.
Hereditary ataxia is caused by genes you’ve inherited from your parents. There are different types of hereditary ataxia.
There are two ways of ataxia being inherited.
Acquired ataxia can develop during someone’s life caused by something other than a gene mutation.
This type of ataxia can be caused by:

conditions like stroke, haemorrhage or transient ischaemic attack (TIA)
gluten intolerance
severe head injury
vitamin deficiency like vitamin E or vitamin B12 deficiency
drinking too much alcohol over a long period of time (alcohol overuse)
recreational inhalants (like nitrous oxide)
bacterial brain infection like meningitis
viral infection
cerebral palsy
multiple sclerosis
an underactive thyroid
cancer
medication like benzodiazepines

It’s possible for someone with acquired ataxia to reduce their symptoms (and sometimes stop them altogether) by making changes to their diet or lifestyle.
You should speak to your doctor before making changes to your diet.
Idiopathic ataxia is a type of ataxia where the cause is not known. Around 50% of people with ataxia have idiopathic ataxia.
People with gluten ataxia are sensitive to a protein in gluten which is found in wheat products. It’s a type of sporadic idiopathic ataxia found in people with no family history of ataxia and no known cause."
Atopic eczema,"Atopic eczema causes areas of skin to become itchy, dry, cracked, sore and red.
There will usually be periods where the symptoms improve, followed by periods where they get worse (flare-ups). Flare-ups may occur as often as 2 or 3 times a month.
Atopic eczema can occur all over the body, but is most common on the hands (especially fingers), the insides of the elbows or backs of the knees, and the face and scalp in children. The face is more commonly involved in adults.
The severity of atopic eczema can vary a lot from person to person. People with mild eczema may only have small areas of dry skin that are occasionally itchy. In more severe cases, atopic eczema can cause widespread red, inflamed skin all over the body and constant itching.
Scratching can disrupt your sleep, make your skin bleed, and cause secondary infections. It can also make itching worse, and a cycle of itching and regular scratching may develop. This can lead to sleepless nights and difficulty concentrating at school or work.
Areas of skin affected by eczema may also turn temporarily darker or lighter after the condition has improved. This is more noticeable in people with darker skin. It’s not a result of scarring or a side effect of steroid creams, but more of a “footprint” of old inflammation and will eventually return to its normal colour.
Occasionally, areas of skin affected by atopic eczema can become infected. Signs of an infection can include:

your eczema getting a lot worse
fluid oozing from the skin
a yellow crust on the skin surface or small yellowish-white spots appearing in the eczema
the skin becoming swollen and sore
a high temperature (fever) and generally feeling unwell

See your doctor as soon as possible if you think your or your child’s skin may have become infected.
Read more about infections and other complications of atopic eczema."
Atrial fibrillation,"Some people with atrial fibrillation have no symptoms. Many will not even be aware that they have an irregular heartbeat. Sometimes it’s only discovered during routine tests or investigations for another condition.
The most obvious symptom of atrial fibrillation is palpitations. Palpitation is an awareness of your heartbeat. For example, your heart might feel like it’s pounding, fluttering or beating irregularly. You may feel these sensations in your chest, throat or neck.
You may feel that your heart is beating fast, even when you’re not exercising.
You may also experience:

tiredness
breathlessness
dizziness
feeling faint
chest discomfort or pain

Atrial fibrillation can be:

intermittent (paroxysmal) – it lasts for a few minutes or hours
persistent – episode lasts for more than 7 days
long-term persistent – it’s continuous and can last over a year
permanent – it does not go away

Atrial fibrillation can come and go, lasting between a few minutes or a few hours. This is known as paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. This means it can be hard to detect paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
A portable or ambulatory electrocardiogram (ECG) recorder can help to diagnose paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. This is because it records your heart rate for 24 hours or longer.
In some cases, atrial fibrillation can be detected by a:

pulse check
single lead ECG device – such as a single sensor attached to the chest or contained in a watch strap

If your doctor thinks you may have atrial fibrillation, you may be referred for other tests. These can include an:

12 lead ECG – a more detailed recording of the heart rhythm from 12 sensors attached to the chest
echocardiogram

You may not need treatment if your doctor has assessed your health and your heart rate returns to normal. Your doctor will decide if you would benefit from any treatment.
This video shows you how to check your pulse.
Anticoagulant medicines prevent harmful blood clots from forming. They are sometimes called blood thinners, but they do not actually thin the blood. Instead they increase the time it takes for your blood to form a clot.
People with atrial fibrillation who are at risk of having a stroke may be prescribed anticoagulant medication. This is to reduce the risk of blood clots forming within the heart which can increase the risk of stroke.
Other treatments for atrial fibrillation focus on controlling the rate and rhythm of the heart. They include:

medication, like beta blockers and anti-arrhythmic drugs
ablation
having a pacemaker fitted
cardioversion

The kind of treatment you will need for atrial fibrillation will depend on:

the type of atrial fibrillation
symptoms
any underlying cause like an overactive thyroid
age
overall health
"
Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD),"If you’re an adult with ADHD, you may find that:

you get easily distracted and find it hard to notice details, particularly with things you find boring
it’s hard to listen to other people – you may find yourself finishing their sentences for them or interrupting them
it’s hard to follow instructions
you find it hard to organise yourself – you start a lot of things without ever finishing them
you find it hard to wait
you fidget and can’t sit still when there’s nothing much going on
you’re forgetful and tend to lose or misplace things
you easily get irritable, impatient or frustrated and lose your temper quickly
you feel restless or edgy, have difficulty turning your thoughts off
you find stress hard to handle
you tend to do things on the spur of the moment, without thinking, which gets you into trouble

Some people with ADHD have problems with inattentiveness, but not with hyperactivity or impulsiveness. 
Some people might have other conditions alongside ADHD. "
Autistic spectrum disorder (ASD),
Bacterial vaginosis,"Often there are no symptoms of bacterial vaginosis. Some women may notice a change in the normal discharge from the vagina.
This discharge will usually be white or grey, thin or watery and have a strong, unpleasant fishy smell. This can be more noticeable during and after sex, and during periods.
Bacterial vaginosis does not usually cause itching or irritation.

Check if you could be triggering it with toiletries.
Consider over the counter treatments from your pharmacy.
Contact your GP practice for an appointment or book an appointment at your local sexual health service.

Sometimes treatment is given based on symptoms without the need for an examination or test.
Sometimes a diagnosis can be made straightaway because of how the discharge looks. Sometimes the sample will be sent to a lab for testing.
You are more likely to need a test if you have frequent episodes of discharge.
Your nurse or doctor may perform an internal examination to check your vagina for signs of bacterial vaginosis. They may use a swab to collect a sample of the discharge from your vagina.
A swab looks a bit like a cotton bud and collecting a sample only takes a few minutes. It’s not painful, but it may be a little uncomfortable for a moment.
If your nurse or doctor suspects you are at risk of an STI they may do more tests.
Bacterial vaginosis is treated with antibiotics. Antibiotics must be prescribed by a doctor or nurse. You may be given an antibiotic cream or gel to use in your vagina, instead of antibiotic tablets by mouth.
While you’re there, make sure you tell the doctor or nurse if you:

are pregnant
think you might be pregnant
are breastfeeding

These may affect the type of treatment you’re given.
You can still have sex while being treated for bacterial vaginosis as it’s not sexually transmitted. However antibiotics and creams can affect condoms and other forms of contraception. Speak to your doctor or pharmacist who can give you further information.
Partners do not usually need treatment.
Non-antibiotic treatment is also available to buy in pharmacies.
Bacteria called lactobacilli naturally live in your vagina and stop other bacteria from growing there.
Sometimes the balance of these bacteria changes. If this happens you can develop bacterial vaginosis.
Bacterial vaginosis can’t be passed on. But it’s more common in sexually active people.
Other things that may increase the risk of getting it include:

having a new sexual partner
having multiple sexual partners
smoking
using scented soaps or perfumed bubble bath
putting antiseptic liquids in the bath
douching (washing or cleaning out the vagina with water or other fluids)
using vaginal washes or deodorant
using strong detergents to wash your underwear
receiving oral sex

The causes of bacterial vaginosis are not fully understood, so it may not be possible to completely prevent it. However, you may be able to lower your risk of developing it by following our genital washing advice."
Benign prostate enlargement,"The symptoms of benign prostate enlargement are caused by the enlarged prostate placing pressure on the bladder and urethra (which carries urine from the bladder to the penis).
This can affect urination in a number of ways. For example, it can:

make it difficult for you to start urinating
weaken the flow of urine or cause ‘stopping and starting’
cause you to strain to pass urine
cause you to need to urinate frequently
cause you to wake up frequently during the night to urinate
cause a sudden urge to urinate, which can result in urinary incontinence if you can’t find a toilet quickly enough
cause you to not be able to empty your bladder fully
cause blood in the urine (haematuria)

In the later stages, benign prostate enlargement can cause urine retention and other complications such as bladder stones, bladder infections and kidney damage.
See your GP if you notice any problems with, or changes to, your usual pattern of urination. Even if the symptoms are mild, they could be caused by a condition that needs to be investigated.
Any blood in the urine must be investigated by your GP to rule out other more serious conditions."
Bile duct cancer (cholangiocarcinoma),"Bile duct cancer doesn’t usually cause any symptoms until the flow of bile from the liver is blocked.
In most cases, the condition is at an advanced stage by this time.
The blockage will cause bile to move back into the blood and body tissue, resulting in symptoms such as:

jaundice – yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes, itchy skin, pale stools and dark-coloured urine
unintentional weight loss 
abdominal pain – most people feel a dull ache in the upper right-hand side of their abdomen (stomach)
high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above and shivering
loss of appetite

Always visit your GP if you have jaundice. While jaundice is unlikely to be caused by bile duct cancer, it could indicate an underlying problem with the liver, such as hepatitis."
Binge eating,"The main sign of binge eating disorder is someone bingeing on a regular basis.
Signs that an episode of overeating is actually a binge, include:

eating much faster than normal
eating until you feel uncomfortably full
eating a large amount of food when you’re not hungry
eating alone or secretly due to being embarrassed about the amount of food you’re consuming
having feelings of guilt, shame or disgust afterwards

If you feel like you have to purge what you’ve eaten after a binge to avoid gaining weight, you may have symptoms of bulimia.
If binges don’t happen regularly, and your weight is very low, you may have symptoms of anorexia.
There are some treatments available for binge eating disorder.
The main type of psychological treatment for binge eating disorder is guided self-help. Guided self-help is where you work through information and activities on your own. You’ll also have regular support sessions with a professional (usually a psychologist).
Another treatment is cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), either individually or as part of a group. CBT starts with the idea that thoughts, feelings, and behaviour are linked and affect one another.
If problems in your life are causing you to binge eat, CBT helps you to reduce bingeing. It helps to identify the underlying issues so you’re less likely to binge in the future.
Learn more about talking therapies
Antidepressants may be used alongside other treatments for binge eating disorder.
Binge eating often leads to weight gain. Being overweight or obese can put you at risk of a number of physical health problems, some of which can be life threatening.
These include:

high cholesterol
high blood pressure
diabetes
osteoarthritis
some types of cancer, like breast cancer and bowel cancer

If you think you might have a binge eating problem, help is available. You can get support to tackle both the physical and mental effects of binge eating.
If you have eating problems or think you may have an eating disorder, it’s important to seek help as soon as possible.
You could:

talk to someone you trust, like a friend or member of your family
see your GP – you may find it helpful to bring someone with you for support

If someone close to you is showing signs of an eating disorder, you can offer help and support.
You could try talking to them about how they feel, and encourage them to think about getting help. Try not to put pressure on them or be critical of them, as this could make things worse. You could also offer to help by going with the person to see their GP.
Your GP or a healthcare professional can give you advice on how to help someone. This includes information on:

the treatments available
how you can support them during their treatment

Beat is a leading charity for people with eating disorders. They have a range of information on the help and support available for people with eating disorders, and their friends and families.
Your GP and care team can recommend other helpful resources."
Bipolar disorder,"Bipolar disorder is characterised by extreme mood swings. These can range from extreme highs (mania) to extreme lows (depression).
Episodes of mania and depression often last for several weeks or months.
During a period of depression, your symptoms may include:

feeling sad, hopeless or irritable most of the time
lacking energy
difficulty concentrating and remembering things
loss of interest in everyday activities
feelings of emptiness or worthlessness
feelings of guilt and despair
feeling pessimistic about everything
self-doubt
being delusional, having hallucinations and disturbed or illogical thinking
lack of appetite
difficulty sleeping
waking up early
suicidal thoughts

The manic phase of bipolar disorder may include:

feeling very happy, elated or overjoyed
talking very quickly
feeling full of energy
feeling self-important
feeling full of great new ideas and having important plans
being easily distracted
being easily irritated or agitated
being delusional, having hallucinations and disturbed or illogical thinking
not feeling like sleeping
not eating
doing things that often have disastrous consequences – such as spending large sums of money on expensive and sometimes unaffordable items
making decisions or saying things that are out of character and that others see as being risky or harmful

If you have bipolar disorder, you may have episodes of depression more regularly than episodes of mania, or vice versa.
Between episodes of depression and mania, you may sometimes have periods where you have a “normal” mood.
The patterns aren’t always the same and some people may experience:

rapid cycling – where a person with bipolar disorder repeatedly swings from a high to low phase quickly without having a “normal” period in between
mixed state – where a person with bipolar disorder experiences symptoms of depression and mania together; for example, overactivity with a depressed mood

If your mood swings last a long time but aren’t severe enough to be classed as bipolar disorder, you may be diagnosed with cyclothymia (a mild form of bipolar disorder).
Bipolar disorder is a condition of extremes. A person with the condition may be unaware they’re in the manic phase.
After the episode is over, they may be shocked at their behaviour. However, at the time, they may believe other people are being negative or unhelpful.
Some people with bipolar disorder have more frequent and severe episodes than others. The extreme nature of the condition means staying in a job may be difficult and relationships may become strained. There’s also an increased risk of suicide.
During episodes of mania and depression, someone with bipolar disorder may experience strange sensations, such as seeing, hearing or smelling things that aren’t there (hallucinations).
They may also believe things that seem irrational to other people (delusions). These types of symptoms are known as psychosis or a psychotic episode.

Bladder cancer,"Blood in your urine is the most common symptom of bladder cancer.
The medical name for this is haematuria and it’s usually painless. You may notice streaks of blood in your urine or the blood may turn your urine brown. The blood isn’t always noticeable and it may come and go.
Less common symptoms of bladder cancer include:

a need to urinate on a more frequent basis
sudden urges to urinate
a burning sensation when passing urine

If bladder cancer reaches an advanced stage and begins to spread, symptoms can include:

pelvic pain 
bone pain
unintentional weight loss 
swelling of the legs

If you ever have blood in your urine – even if it comes and goes – you should speak to your GP, so the cause can be investigated.
Having blood in your urine doesn’t mean you definitely have bladder cancer. There are other, more common, causes including:

a urinary tract infection, such as cystitis

Blood poisoning (sepsis),"In some cases, symptoms of more severe sepsis or septic shock (when your blood pressure drops to a dangerously low level) develop.
These can include:

feeling dizzy or faint
a change in mental state – like confusion or disorientation
diarrhoea
nausea and vomiting
slurred speech
severe muscle pain
severe breathlessness
less urine production than normal – for example, not urinating for a day
cold, clammy and pale or mottled skin
loss of consciousness
"
Bone cancer,"Bone pain is the most common symptom of bone cancer. Some people experience other symptoms as well.
Pain caused by bone cancer usually begins with a feeling of tenderness in the affected bone. This gradually progresses to a persistent ache or ache that comes and goes, which continues at night and when resting.
Any bone can be affected, although bone cancer most often develops in the long bones of the legs or upper arms.
The pain can sometimes be wrongly mistaken for arthritis in adults and growing pains in children and teenagers.
Some people also experience swelling and redness (inflammation) or notice a lump on or around the affected bone. If the bone is near a joint, the swelling may make it difficult to use the joint.
In some cases, the cancer can weaken a bone, causing it to break (fracture) easily after a minor injury or fall.
Less common symptoms can include:

a high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above
unexplained weight loss
sweating, particularly at night

Speak to your GP if you or your child experiences persistent, severe or worsening bone pain, or if you’re worried about any symptoms.
While it’s highly unlikely that your symptoms are caused by cancer, it’s best to be sure by getting a proper diagnosis.

Brain tumours: Teenagers and young adults,"This section on brain tumours is for teenagers and young adults.
The symptoms of a brain tumour depend on the size of the tumour and where it is.
The tumour can:

cause fits
affect the messages sent by that part of the brain to other parts of the body
cause ‘raised intracranial pressure’ – there’s only a certain amount of space in the skull for the brain and as a tumour grows, there can be a rise in pressure in or around the brain

Common symptoms of ‘raised intracranial pressure’ are:

headaches, which are often worse in the morning
vomiting (usually in the morning) or feeling sick
fits (seizures)
feeling very irritated or losing interest in day-to-day things like friends, school or going out
problems with your eyes, such as blurring or seeing double
feeling more sleepy or drowsy than usual
changes in your balance and walking, or weakness down one side of the body
problems with speech
personality changes

There’s often a simple explanation for many of these symptoms. But if you have any of these or if you’re worried, it’s important to speak to your GP straight away."
Breast cancer (female),"The first symptom of breast cancer most women notice is a lump or an area of thickened tissue in their breast.
Most breast lumps (90%) aren’t cancerous, but it’s always best to have them checked by your doctor.
You should speak to your GP if you notice any of the following:

a lump or area of thickened tissue in either breast
a change in the size or shape of one or both breasts
discharge from either of your nipples (which may be streaked with blood)
a lump or swelling in either of your armpits
dimpling on the skin of your breasts
a rash on or around your nipple
a change in the appearance of your nipple, such as becoming sunken into your breast

Breast pain alone isn’t a symptom of breast cancer.

Macmillan Cancer Support: Signs and symptoms of breast cancer

It’s important to be breast aware, so you can pick up any changes as soon as possible. Get to know what is normal for you. For instance, your breasts may look or feel different at different times of your life. This will make it much easier to spot potential problems.

"
Breast cancer (male),"The main symptom of breast cancer in men is a hard lump in one of your breasts. The lump is almost always painless.
The lump is usually located underneath the nipple and areola (the circle of dark-coloured skin surrounding the nipple).
However, the vast majority of breast lumps are caused by a condition called gynaecomastia. This is a common non-cancerous condition where male breast tissue becomes enlarged.
Less common symptoms of male breast cancer include:

the nipple beginning to turn in on itself (nipple retraction)
the nipple becoming hard and inflamed, and looking sore (nipple ulceration)
fluid leaking from the nipple (nipple discharge)

Additional symptoms usually only develop if the cancer spreads from the breast to other parts of the body, such as the bones, liver or lungs. This is known as metastatic breast cancer.
Symptoms of metastatic breast cancer include:

bone pain
swelling of the lymph nodes (glands), usually in or around the armpit
shortness of breath
feeling unusually tired all the time
feeling sick (nausea)
itchy skin with yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice)

You should always visit your GP if you notice a lump in your breast or you have problems affecting your nipples, such as retraction, ulceration or discharge. 
These problems are unlikely to be of the result of breast cancer, but they should be investigated further."
Bronchiectasis,"The most common symptoms of bronchiectasis include:

a persistent cough that usually brings up mucus
recurrent chest infections
fatigue

Symptoms can vary from person to person. They tend to get worse if you have an infection in your lungs.
Your GP may:

ask you about your symptoms
ask whether you smoke
listen to your lungs with a stethoscope (the lungs of people with bronchiectasis often make a distinctive crackling noise)
send you for an X-ray to rule out other conditions

If your GP thinks you may have a lung infection, they may take a sample of mucus so it can be checked for bacteria.
If your GP thinks you may have bronchiectasis, they’ll refer you to a specialist in treating lung conditions for further tests such as:

a CT scan – to see if your airways have widened or to see any signs of chronic infection
blood tests – to check how well your immune system is working
mucus (sputum) test – to check for bacteria or fungi
throat swab – to look for viruses
genetic screening test – where a sample of blood or saliva is checked for the faulty gene that causes cystic fibrosis
lung function test – to measure how hard and how quickly you can blow out air from your lungs to check how well they’re working
bronchoscopy – a flexible tube with a camera to look into your lungs to look for anything abnormal and to take samples from the airways if a chronic infection is suspected

The damage caused to the lungs by bronchiectasis is permanent. But treatment can help your symptoms and stop the damage getting worse.
The main treatments include:

exercises and special devices to help you clear mucus out of your lungs
medication to help improve airflow within the lungs
antibiotics to treat any lung infections

You should:

stop smoking (if you smoke)
have the flu vaccine every year
make sure you have had the pneumococcal vaccine to protect against pneumonia
make sure you have had the coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine
exercise regularly
keep yourself well hydrated
aim for a healthy weight

Surgery for bronchiectasis is only in rare cases. It’s only used if other treatments haven’t worked, the damage to the lung is localised to one lobe, and you’re otherwise healthy.
There are a range of exercises which can help to remove mucus from your lungs. These are known as airway clearance techniques. They can often help coughing and breathlessness.
You can be referred to a physiotherapist who can teach you these techniques.
Active cycle of breathing techniques (ACBT) involves you repeating a cycle made up of different steps. For example, a period of normal breathing, followed by deep breaths to loosen the mucus and force it up. Then you cough the mucus out. The cycle is then repeated for 20 to 30 minutes.
Do not attempt ACBT if you haven’t first been taught the steps by a physiotherapist. Doing it incorrectly could damage your lungs.
If you’re otherwise healthy, you’ll probably only need to do ACBT once or twice a day. If you develop a lung infection, you may need to do it more.
Changing your position can also make it easier to remove mucus from your lungs. This is known as postural drainage. The steps are usually done with the help of a physiotherapist or carer.
There are also handheld devices that can help to remove mucus from your lungs. Generally, they use a combination of vibrations and air pressure to make it easier to cough out any mucus.
Examples of these devices include the Flutter, the RC cornet, the Acapella and the Aerobika.
These devices aren’t always available on the NHS. You may have to pay for one yourself.
In some cases, medications to make breathing or clearing your lungs easier may be prescribed.
If you have very severe symptoms, you may be prescribed bronchodilator medications.
Bronchodilators are medications you breathe in. They help make breathing easier by relaxing the muscles in the lungs. Examples of this type of medication include:

beta-2 agonist such as salbutamol, terbutaline, formoterol or salmeterol
antimuscarinics such as tiotropium, glycopyrronium or aclidinium

If your symptoms are getting worse because of infection, you’ll need to be treated with antibiotics.
If you’re well enough to be treated at home, you’ll probably be prescribed 2 to 3 antibiotic tablets a day for 14 days. It’s important to finish the course even if you feel better.
Recovering fully from a bronchiectasis exacerbation can take months.
If your symptoms are more severe, you may need to go to hospital for antibiotic injections.
If you have 3 or more infections in a year, or your symptoms during infection are very severe, you may be given antibiotics on a long-term basis.
Occasionally, medication breathed in through a device called a nebuliser may be recommended. This makes it easier to clear your lungs.
Nebulisers have:

a face mask or mouthpiece
a chamber to change medication into a fine mist
a compressor to pump the medication into your lungs

Different medications can be given using a nebuliser. For example, salt water solutions, which should only be used if prescribed by your healthcare professional. These medications help to reduce the thickness of your mucus so it’s easier to cough out.
The medications used with a nebuliser can be provided on prescription. But the nebuliser device itself isn’t always available on the NHS. You may have to pay for a device, but only if it is advised for use by your healthcare professional.
The cause of bronchiectasis is not fully understood. Widened airways and increased risk of infection can be linked to:

previous infections, such as pneumonia or whooping cough
problems with the immune system (the body’s defence against infection)
having long-term lung conditions (COPD)
allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) – if you breathe in spores from a fungi that you’re allergic to

In most cases of bronchiectasis, no clear cause can be found. This is known as idiopathic bronchiectasis."
Bronchitis,"The main symptom is a hacking cough, which may bring up yellow-green mucus (phlegm). Bronchitis may also cause:

sore throat
headache
runny or blocked nose
aches and pains
tiredness
shortness of breath or wheezing

In most cases, bronchitis will clear up by itself within a few weeks without needing treatment. This type of bronchitis is known as acute bronchitis.
Your cough may last for several weeks after other symptoms have gone. You may also find that the continual coughing makes your chest and stomach muscles sore.
Pneumonia is the most common complication of bronchitis. It happens when the infection spreads further into the lungs, causing air sacs inside the lungs to fill up with fluid.
People at an increased risk of developing pneumonia include:

elderly people
people who smoke
people with other health conditions, such as heart, liver or kidney disease
people with a weakened immune system

Mild pneumonia can usually be treated with antibiotics at home. More severe cases may need treatment in hospital."
Bulimia,"The main symptoms of bulimia are:

bingeing – overeating in a particular pattern
purging – trying to reduce the effect of binging by attempting to get calories out of your body
focus on food – thinking about food all the time, even when you don’t want to
problems with self-esteem
focussing on body image when it comes to food and weight

When making a diagnosis, your GP will probably ask questions about your eating habits. For example, they could ask:

how you feel about your weight
if you’re concerned about it
if you make yourself vomit regularly
if you binge-eat

It’s important to answer these questions honestly. Your GP isn’t trying to judge you or ‘catch you out’. They just need to accurately assess how serious your symptoms are.
Your GP may check your weight and calculate your body mass index (BMI).
Your GP might check your pulse and blood pressure.
Sometimes an (electrocardiogram (ECG) may be needed to check how well your heart is working.
Your GP may do blood tests to check the level of:

fluids in your body
chemicals or minerals, like potassium in your blood

Blood tests look for the complications of bulimia. Even if they come back as ‘normal’, your GP may still refer you to a specialist if you’re experiencing bulimia symptoms.
Before your treatment begins, you’ll probably have an overall assessment of your health. Your GP or another healthcare professional will do this.
The assessment will help your healthcare professional plan for your treatment and care. For example, they may assess:

your overall health and any medical needs
your social situation, like how much support you have from family and friends
your mood
any risks that affect you, like whether you’re at risk of harming yourself
whether there are any physical risks as a result of bulimia that need urgent treatment

For many people, guided self-help can be an effective treatment for bulimia. Guided self-help is where you work through information and activities on your own. You’ll have regular support sessions with a professional (usually a psychologist).
Activities can include:

worksheets
a food diary
meal plan
writing about difficult thoughts and feelings

If guided self help is unsuccessful, your GP can refer you for treatment to an eating disorder service. An eating disorder service will usually offer a structured programme of psychological treatment.
The main type of psychological treatment for bulimia is cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). CBT starts with the idea that thoughts, feelings, and behaviour are linked and affect one another. CBT helps to change the harmful behaviour while working on changing how you think about food, eating, and weight.
One alternative to CBT is interpersonal therapy (IPT). IPT explores the way you interact with other people. It also looks at the relationships you have, with the goal of improving them.
Learn more about talking therapies
Antidepressants like selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) may be used to treat bulimia. They can reduce the urges to binge and vomit.
The medication will usually take several weeks before it starts to work. You’ll usually start on a low dose. The dose will gradually increase as your body adjusts to the medicine.
Very few drugs are recommended for children and young people below the age of 18. It’s best not to take SSRIs if you have epilepsy or a family history of heart, liver or kidney disease.
Recovery from bulimia can take a long time. It’s common for bulimia symptoms to return after treatment. This is often called a relapse, and is more likely during times of stress. If relapse happens, the approach to getting treatment is the same. The first step is going to your GP.
There are physical complications associated with bulimia.
These can include:

dental problems – regular vomiting can cause your stomach acid to damage the enamel on your teeth, which can lead to tooth decay
repeated vomiting can cause bad breath and a sore throat
due to a lack of nutrients, your skin and hair can become dry and your fingernails can become brittle
your saliva glands can become swollen from frequent vomiting, which makes your face appear rounder
frequent use of laxatives can damage your bowel muscles, causing permanent constipation (finding it difficult to poo)
an increased risk of heart problems

Frequent vomiting or laxative use can cause:

tiredness
weakness
abnormal heart rhythms
kidney damage
convulsions (fits)
muscle spasms

If you have periods, bulimia can cause them to become unpredictable, or stop altogether. This does not mean bulimia makes you infertile. While it may be harder to get pregnant, you should continue to use birth control if you aren’t planning a pregnancy.
If you have diabetes, you’ll need regular health checks to help avoid problems with your eyes or other serious complications. This is particularly important if you have type 1 diabetes.
People with bulimia can be anxious about seeking treatment that might mean making changes to their eating habits.
If you have eating problems or think you may have bulimia, it’s important to seek help as soon as possible. You could start by:

talking to someone you trust, like a friend or member of your family
going to see your GP – you may find it helpful to bring someone with you for support

If someone close to you is showing signs of bulimia, you can offer help and support.
You could try talking to them about how they feel, and encourage them to think about getting help. Try not to put pressure on them or be critical of them, as this could make things worse. You could also offer to help by going with the person to see their GP.
You could speak to your own GP or a healthcare professional if you’d like some advice on how to help someone.
You could also get help from a support group for people who have loved ones with eating disorders. Your GP or Scotland’s Service Directory can help you find services near you.
Beat has a range of information on the help and support available for people with eating disorders, and their friends and families."
Bunion,
Carcinoid syndrome and carcinoid tumours,"Typical symptoms of carcinoid syndrome include:

diarrhoea, tummy pain and loss of appetite
flushing of the skin, particularly the face
fast heart rate
breathlessness and wheezing

These symptoms may come on unexpectedly, as the hormones can be produced by the tumour at any time.
Some people may also develop carcinoid heart disease, where the heart valves thicken and stop working properly. There is also a risk of developing a rare but serious reaction called a carcinoid crisis, which involves severe flushing, breathlessness and a drop in blood pressure.
It’s not known exactly why carcinoid tumours develop, but it’s thought that most occur by chance.
Your chances of developing a carcinoid tumour may be increased if you have:

a rare family syndrome called multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1)
parents or siblings with a carcinoid tumour
parents with squamous cell skin cancer, non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, or cancer of the brain, breast, liver, womb, bladder or kidney
conditions called neurofibromatosis or tuberous sclerosis

A carcinoid tumour may be found incidentally – for example, as a surgeon is removing an appendix. In this case, the tumour will often be caught early and removed along with the appendix, causing no further problems.
Otherwise, people usually speak to their GP after they have developed symptoms. A carcinoid tumour may be diagnosed after carrying out a series of scans and tests, which may include measuring the amount of serotonin in your urine and having an endoscopy.
If the tumour is caught early, it may be possible to completely remove it and cure the cancer altogether. Otherwise, surgeons will remove as much of the tumour as possible (debulking).
You can read more about the surgery for carcinoid tumours on the Cancer Research UK website.
If the tumour cannot be removed, but it’s not growing or causing symptoms, you may not need treatment straight away – it might just be carefully monitored. 
If it’s causing symptoms, you may be offered one of the following treatments:

injections of medicines called somatostatin analogues, such as octreotide and lanreotide, which can slow down the growth of the tumour
radiotherapy to kill some of the cancer cells
a procedure to block the blood supply to the tumour (for tumours in the liver), known as hepatic artery embolisation
a procedure that uses a heated probe to kill cancer cells (for tumours in the liver), called radiofrequency ablation
chemotherapy to shrink the tumour and control your symptoms

Symptoms of carcinoid syndrome can be treated with injections of octreotide and lanreotide. You may also be given medication to widen your airways (to relieve wheezing and breathlessness) and anti-diarrhoea medication.
There are things you can do yourself to manage some of the symptoms of carcinoid syndrome.
Generally, you should avoid triggers of flushing, such as:

alcohol
large meals
spicy foods
foods containing the substance tyramine, such as aged cheese and salted or pickled meats
stress

Some medications, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants, may make symptoms worse by further increasing your levels of serotonin – but never stop taking medication without seeking medical advice.
If you have diarrhoea, it’s important to keep drinking little and often to avoid dehydration.
If the whole tumour can be removed, this may cure the cancer and symptoms altogether. But even if surgeons cannot remove the entire tumour, it usually grows slowly and can be controlled with medication.
Overall, people with carcinoid tumours have a good life expectancy compared to many other cancers. Many people remain relatively well and lead active lives, with only occasional symptoms.
But as the tumour grows or spreads, it will produce more and more hormones, and it may eventually be difficult to completely control symptoms with medication. You may need further surgery or other treatments.
Unfortunately, life expectancy is not as good for cancer that has spread to other parts of your body, because it won’t usually be possible to remove all of it. However, treatment can still control your symptoms and slow down the spread of cancer.
If you have carcinoid syndrome, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS).
This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time.

Cardiovascular disease,
Carpal tunnel syndrome,
Catarrh,"Catarrh can lead to a:

constant need to clear your throat
feeling that your throat is blocked
blocked or stuffy nose that you can’t clear
runny nose
feeling of mucus running down the back of your throat
persistent cough
headache
facial pain
reduced sense of smell and taste
crackling sensation in your ear and some temporary hearing loss

These problems can be frustrating to live with. They may affect your sleep, making you feel tired.
Your GP may check if there’s a condition causing it like nasal polyps or allergies.
You may be referred to a specialist for tests.
Catarrh will often pass in a few days or weeks.
You can ask a pharmacist for:

advice about catarrh
over-the-counter medications such as decongestants, antihistamines or steroid nasal sprays

Catarrh is usually caused by the immune system reacting to an infection or irritation. This causes the lining of your nose and throat to become swollen and produce mucus.
This can be triggered by:

a cold or other infections
hay fever or other types of allergic rhinitis
non-allergic rhinitis
nasal polyps

Treating the underlying condition, if you have one, may help your catarrh.
It’s unclear what causes chronic catarrh, but it’s often the result of an allergy or infection. It may be linked to an:

abnormality in the way mucus travels within the nose
increased sensitivity to mucus in the back of the nose and throat
"
Cellulitis,"Cellulitis causes an area of skin to suddenly become:

red
hot
swollen
painful
tender

It most often affects the lower legs, but can occur anywhere.
In more severe cases, cellulitis can also be accompanied – and often preceded – by:

a high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above
vigorous shaking (rigors)
nausea and vomiting
dizziness
confusion

These are signs that the infection has spread deeper into the body.
Read more about the symptoms of cellulitis
See your pharmacist as soon as possible if an area of your skin suddenly turns red, painful and hot.
Early treatment can help reduce the risk of the infection becoming severe.
Cellulitis is usually treated with antibiotics. Many infections can be treated with antibiotic tablets at home.
You’ll usually be given a five-day course of treatment, and your symptoms should start to improve after a few days.
Make sure you complete the whole course of medicine you’ve been given, even if you’re feeling better. Contact your GP if your symptoms get worse after a few days or don’t improve within a week.
For serious infections, treatment is usually started in hospital. You’ll normally be given antibiotics directly into a vein through an injection or a drip.
Many hospitals can then arrange for this treatment to continue at home or in an outpatient clinic. Treatment is usually for five days.
If the infection responds to treatment quickly, it may be possible to complete the course with antibiotic tablets instead of having injections or a drip.
Read more about how cellulitis is treated.
Cellulitis can usually be treated successfully with antibiotics, and most people make a full recovery.
But there is a risk it could cause potentially serious problems, particularly if it’s not treated quickly, such as:

blood poisoning (sepsis) – where the bacteria enter the blood
kidney damage
leg ulcers

Septicaemia and kidney problems can be life threatening and require immediate treatment in hospital."
Cerebral palsy,"The symptoms of cerebral palsy can vary from person to person and are dependent on the type of brain injury or abnormality. Someone with cerebral palsy may:

struggle with movement and balance, and may be unable to walk
struggle to speak, and possibly need to use electronic aids
have difficulties with eating, drinking and swallowing
have problems with their vision
experience pain symptoms
experience fatigue (tiredness)
have problems with their sleep
have epilepsy
have a learning disability
display behavioural problems
have bladder control problems
have problems with their digestive system (constipation)
struggle to control their saliva
struggle to process information from their senses

A person with cerebral palsy may have secondary symptoms. These are caused by the impact of the condition on their body, rather than directly by cerebral palsy. These can include:

tightness in joints and muscles
dislocations
a change in their physical abilities
changes in the amount of pain they experience
increased fatigue
"
Cervical cancer,"The symptoms of cervical cancer aren’t always obvious, and it may not cause any symptoms at all until it’s reached an advanced stage.
This is why it’s very important that you attend all of your cervical screening appointments.
In most cases, vaginal bleeding is the first noticeable symptom of cervical cancer. It usually occurs after having sex.
Bleeding at any other time, other than your expected monthly period is also considered unusual. This includes bleeding after the menopause (when a woman’s monthly periods stop).
Visit your GP for advice if you experience any type of unusual vaginal bleeding.
Other symptoms of cervical cancer may include pain and discomfort during sex and an unpleasant smelling vaginal discharge.
If the cancer spreads out of your cervix and into surrounding tissue and organs, it can trigger a range of other symptoms, including:

constipation 
blood in your urine (haematuria)
loss of bladder control (urinary incontinence)
bone pain
swelling of one of your legs
severe pain in your side or back caused by swelling in your kidneys, related to a condition called hydronephrosis
changes to your bladder and bowel habits
loss of appetite
weight loss
tiredness and a lack of energy

You should contact your GP if you experience:

bleeding after sex (postcoital bleeding)
bleeding outside of your normal periods
new bleeding after the menopause

Vaginal bleeding is very common and can have a wide range of causes, so it doesn’t necessarily mean you have cervical cancer. However, unusual vaginal bleeding is a symptom that needs to be investigated by your GP."
Cervical spondylosis,"Many people experience no noticeable symptoms. It’s common to experience some or all of these symptoms including:

neck pain
stiffness
headaches which usually start at the back of the head, just above the neck, and travel over the top to the forehead.

Pain usually comes and goes, with flare-ups followed by symptom-free periods.
Rarely, it can irritate a nerve in the neck, which can cause symptoms such as pain and or altered sensation in your arm for example pins and needles or numbness. If any of these occur, it’s a good idea to talk to a health care professional.
In order for cervical spondylosis to be diagnosed you will need an assessment from a healthcare professional.
They’ll initially ask you questions about your neck issue and then carry out a physical examination. This may include checking your range of movement and strength.
You may sometimes need to have a further examination to rule out other possible health conditions.
Cervical spondylosis is a long term condition, and symptoms are often variable from day to day.  Many patients have found that managing their symptoms can help improve their quality of life. 
There are some things you can do to help manage this condition yourself.
Read more about exercises for cervical spondylosis
Cervical spondylosis can sometimes mean you need to take some time off work to help recovery. How long you’re off will depend on the nature of your condition and your role at work.
You do not need to be symptom free before you consider returning to work. Continuing to go to work, or returning to work as soon as is possible for you, will help your recovery. Gradually getting back to your normal daily activities can help to build up your strength and stamina levels.
Following this advice, you should see gradual improvements over time.
You should see the biggest change in your symptoms within the first couple of weeks. Most problems should have improved within 6 weeks.
If your neck pain hasn’t improved within 6 weeks of following this advice, or if your symptoms get worse at any time, it’s a good idea to talk to a healthcare professional about your symptoms.

When dealing with any health condition it’s important to also look after your mental wellbeing as this can impact your recovery."
Chest and rib injury,"Rib and chest injuries can cause a range of symptoms including:

pain
bruising
swelling
clicking in the chest

You may have some or none of these.
It’s typical with this type of injury to have increased pain when:

taking a deep breath
coughing
laughing
sneezing
moving a certain way

There are strategies to help manage this.
Your risk if getting a chest infection is higher after a chest or rib injury. There’s lots you can do to minimise the chance of this happening.
There are lots of things you can do yourself to manage your injury and any pain you’re experiencing.
Managing your pain is one of the most effective ways to prevent breathing problems. It’ll also help reduce your chance of developing a chest infection.
Regular pain medication can help to reduce the pain. It can also help you take deep breaths and sleep more comfortably.
If over the counter medication is ineffective it’s a good idea to talk to your healthcare professional.
More about taking painkillers
You might need to change how you sleep. You might find it more comfortable to sleep in an upright position for the first few nights following a chest or rib injury.
If you wear a bra, you may want to try wearing it when sleeping as some people find this more comfortable.
To help prevent a chest infection it’s recommended you do some breathing exercises. These help your lungs expand fully.
It’s important to do this every hour you’re awake, at the beginning of your recovery.
This will be most beneficial if you can sit upright.
Aim to take a deep breath in, hold for three to four seconds and then a slow, relaxed breath out. Do this 3 times and then try a huff or cough.
Coughing when you have a chest or rib injury can be painful. Use this technique to minimise pain and make sure your cough is effective to help clear your chest.
Rather than coughing as you would normally, try to use a ‘huff’ instead.
A huff is a fast breath out, like you would do to steam up and clean a pair of glasses.
Doing 2 or 3 huffs at a time after breathing exercises, should help make it easier for you to cough up any phlegm. It may help to reduce your pain to hug a pillow or cushion to your chest as you do this.
Watch the video to find out how to do these.
Keeping active is an essential part of your treatment and recovery.
It’s important to try to keep moving as normally as possible during your recovery. It’s best to avoid long periods of bed rest where possible.
You can try to increase your activity gradually to help your recovery.
Generally, the first few days are the most painful and when your movement will be most limited. Initially, you should listen to your body and adapt your life to suit.
Too much rest can slow down your recovery. As soon as you can, start moving and using the affected area.
Remember a little activity is better than nothing. Continue to stay within acceptable pain limits but you don’t need to be pain free. Aim to do a little bit more each day or every few days.
This guide can help you to understand if you’re pacing your daily activities at the right level as you progress. It’ll also let you see how much pain or discomfort is acceptable.
It can be helpful to rate your pain out of 10 (0 being no pain, 10 being the worst pain you’ve ever had), for example:

0 to 3 – minimal pain
4 to 5 – acceptable pain
6 to 10 – excessive pain

Activity should not make your existing pain worse overall. Increasing activity can lead to increased discomfort as your body gets used to regaining your activity levels.
Aim to keep your pain within a rating of 0 to 5. If your pain gets above this level, you can change the level of activity by:

reducing the number of times you do a movement
reducing the pace of an activity
increasing rest time between activities

Most of the healing happens between 6 to 8 weeks after your injury.
It’s normal to have aches and discomfort beyond this. This usually happens when you try activities you haven’t done for a while. It’s also normal for the area to be more sensitive for a while after the injury.
You should contact your insurance provider before driving. Your injury may affect your insurance.
You must be able to safely perform an emergency stop or manoeuvre. You should always be in full control of your vehicle.
Your return to work will depend on the type of work you do and your employer. It may be possible to discuss a phased return to work or changed duties.
You don’t need to see a healthcare professional to return to work.
Keep doing any activities you’re able to, as your pain allows. Gradually increase what you do.
Reduced flexibility and strength may make things more difficult to start with. This will get better as you slowly build up to all of your usual activities.
Frustration or low mood after an injury is normal. As you get back to normal life this should get better.
Loss of confidence is common after an injury.
Further advice about preventing falls
If your symptoms haven’t improved within 8 weeks of following this advice, it’s a good idea to talk to a healthcare professional."
Chest infection,
Chickenpox,"Chickenpox causes a rash of red, itchy spots that turn into fluid-filled blisters. They then crust over to form scabs, which eventually drop off.
The spots normally appear in clusters and tend to be:

behind the ears
on the face
over the scalp
on the chest and belly
on the arms and legs

But, the spots can be anywhere on the body, including:

inside the ears and mouth
on the palms of the hands
soles of the feet
inside the nappy area.

The rash starts as small, itchy red spots. These develop a blister on top and become very itchy after about 12 to 14 hours.
After a day or two, the fluid in the blisters gets cloudy and they begin to dry out and crust over.
After 1 to 2 weeks, the crusting skin will fall off naturally.
New spots can keep appearing in waves for 3 to 5 days after the rash begins. So, different groups of spots may be at different stages of blistering or drying out.
Before the rash appears, you or your child may have some mild flu-like symptoms, including:

feeling sick
a high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or over
aching, painful muscles
headache
generally feeling unwell
loss of appetite

These symptoms, especially the fever, tend to be more common and worse in adults than in children.
For most children, chickenpox is a mild illness that gets better on its own.
Chickenpox tends to be more severe in adults than children. Adults have a higher risk of developing complications.
There is no treatment for chickenpox. But, you can get remedies from your pharmacy that can help symptoms. These include:

paracetamol to help bring down a fever
calamine lotion and cooling gels to ease itching.

In most children, the blisters crust up and fall off naturally within 1 to 2 weeks.
Adults with chickenpox may be helped by taking antiviral medicine if its diagnosed early enough.
You should keep children off school or nursery until all their spots have crusted over. This will help stop chickenpox being spread.
Adults with chickenpox should stay off work until all the spots have crusted over.
Chickenpox is infectious from 1 to 2 days before the rash starts. It stops being infectious when all the blisters have crusted over. This happens usually 5 to 6 days after the start of the rash.
If you or your child has chickenpox, try to keep them away from public areas. This will help them avoid contact with people who may not have had it.
You should especially stay away from people who are at risk of serious problems, such as:

newborn babies
pregnant women
anyone with a weakened immune system, (for example people having cancer treatment or taking steroid tablets)

Some children and adults are at special risk of serious problems if they catch chickenpox. They include:

pregnant women
newborn babies
people with a weakened immune system

These people should speak to their GP as soon as they are exposed to the chickenpox virus or they develop chickenpox symptoms.
They may need a blood test to check if they are protected from (immune to) chickenpox.
If you’re pregnant, chickenpox can occasionally cause complications.
Chickenpox occurs in approximately 3 in every 1,000 pregnancies.
Your risk of developing pneumonia is slightly higher if you’re pregnant, especially if you smoke. The further you are into your pregnancy, the more serious the risk of pneumonia tends to be.
If you get chickenpox while you’re pregnant, there is also a small but significant risk to your unborn baby.
If you get chickenpox during the first 28 weeks of your pregnancy, there is a risk that your unborn baby could develop a condition known as foetal varicella syndrome (FVS).
This syndrome is rare.
FVS can cause serious complications, including:

scarring
eye defects, such as cataracts
shortened limbs
brain damage

There are also other risks from catching chickenpox after week 20 of pregnancy.
It’s possible that your baby may be born prematurely (before week 37 of the pregnancy).
If you are infected with chickenpox 7 days before or 7 days after giving birth, your newborn baby may develop a more serious type of chickenpox. In a few severe cases, this type of chickenpox can be fatal.
Once you have had chickenpox, you usually develop antibodies to the infection and become immune to catching it again.
But, the virus that causes chickenpox, the varicella-zoster virus, stays inactive in your body’s nerve tissues. This can come back later in life as an illness called shingles.
It’s possible to catch chickenpox from someone with shingles, but not the other way around.
Read more about shingles.
There is a chickenpox vaccine, but it is not part of the routine childhood vaccination schedule.
Only children and adults who are more vulnerable to the complications of chickenpox will get offered the vaccine.
It may be possible to develop the infection after vaccination. There is also a chance that someone who has had the vaccine could develop chickenpox after coming into close contact with a person who has shingles."
Chilblains,"Chilblains most often affect the body’s extremities, such as the toes, fingers, heels, ears and nose.
They usually develop several hours after being in the cold.
Symptoms of chilblains include:

a burning or itching feeling in the affected areas, which can get worse if you go into a warm room
swelling
the affected skin turning red or dark blue
in severe cases, the surface of the skin breaks, and sores or blisters develop

You do not usually need to see a GP, as chilblains normally get better on their own within a few weeks.
Chilblains often get better on their own without treatment.
A soothing lotion, such as calamine or witch hazel, can help relieve itching. A pharmacist can give you advice about the right product for you.
If your chilblains are severe and keep returning, your GP may prescribe a medication called nifedipine. You take nifedipine as a daily tablet or capsule. It works by relaxing the blood vessels, improving your circulation.
Nifedipine can help existing chilblains heal, or can be taken to stop them developing.
Chilblains are caused by an abnormal reaction to the cold. They’re common in the UK because the weather is damp and cold in the winter.
Some people develop chilblains that last for several months every winter.
When the skin is cold, blood vessels near its surface get narrower. If the skin is then exposed to heat, the blood vessels become wider. If this happens too quickly, blood vessels near the surface of the skin can’t always handle the increased blood flow. Blood can leak into the surrounding tissue, which may cause the swelling and itchiness of chilblains.
Some people are more at risk of chilblains than others. This includes people with:

poor circulation
a family history of chilblains
regular exposure to cold, damp or draughty conditions
a poor diet or low body weight
lupus – a long-term condition that causes swelling in the body’s tissues
Raynaud’s phenomenon – a common condition that affects the blood supply to certain parts of the body, usually the fingers and toes

People who smoke are more at risk of chilblains as nicotine constricts blood vessels.
Chilblains can also occur on areas of the feet exposed to pressure. For example, a bunion or a toe that’s squeezed by tight shoes.
If you’re more at risk of chilblains, you help prevent them by:

staying out of the cold where possible
looking after your feet
improving your circulation

If your skin gets cold, you should warm it up gradually. Heating the skin too quickly – for example, by placing your feet in hot water or near a heater – is one of the main causes of chilblains.
If you have severe or recurring chilblains, there’s a small risk of complications such as:

infection from blistered or scratched skin
ulcers forming on the skin
permanent discolouration of the skin
scarring of the skin

It’s often possible to avoid complications of chilblains.
You can reduce your risk of infection by:

cleaning any breaks in your skin with antiseptic
covering the area with an antiseptic dressing
changing the dressing every other day until your skin heals

If the skin does become infected, you may be prescribed antibiotics."
Chlamydia,"Most people with chlamydia don’t notice any symptoms and don’t know they have it. So it’s important to get tested if you think you’re infected.
If you do get symptoms, it’s usually 1 to 3 weeks after having unprotected sex. Some people don’t get symptoms until months later.
If you do develop symptoms, you may experience:

pain when peeing
unusual discharge from the vagina, penis or anus
pain in the lower tummy, bleeding after sex, and bleeding between periods
pain in the testicles
red, sticky eyes

Sometimes symptoms can disappear after a few days. Even if symptoms go away you may still have the infection and could pass it on.
If you think you might have chlamydia, get tested for free by:

booking an appointment at your local sexual health service (if you have symptoms)
contacting your GP practice for an appointment (if you have symptoms)
ordering a home test kit (if you do not have symptoms)

Services available may vary depending on where you live.
The test for chlamydia is simple, painless and very reliable. It involves sending a sample from the area of the body thought to be infected to a lab for analysis.
You usually don’t have to be examined by a doctor or nurse and can often collect the sample yourself.
The 2 main ways the sample can be collected are:

using a swab – a small cotton bud is gently wiped over the area that might be infected, such as inside the vagina, throat, or inside the anus
urine sample (if you have a penis) – this is more accurate if it’s at least 1 or 2 hours after you last peed

People who have had anal or oral sex may have a swab taken from their anus or throat.
Antibiotics will treat the chlamydia infection.
You should avoid having sex until 1 week after you and your partner(s) have been treated. This includes oral sex and sex using a condom.
If chlamydia is left untreated you may pass it on to other sexual partners.
If chlamydia is left untreated in women, it can spread to the womb and cause a serious condition called pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). This is a major cause of ectopic pregnancy and infertility in women.
If men are not treated, the infection may spread to the testicles and cause discomfort. This could affect your fertility.
You can get chlamydia by having unprotected vaginal, anal or oral sex (sex without a condom). Other ways of getting chlamydia include:

sharing sex toys that aren’t washed or covered with a new condom each time they’re used
infected semen or vaginal fluid getting into your eye

Chlamydia can be passed from a pregnant woman to her baby during childbirth.
Any sexually active person can get chlamydia. It’s most common in people under the age of 30.
You can have had chlamydia for a while without knowing.
The best way to reduce your risk of STIs is to practice safer sex. This means using a condom for vaginal, anal and oral sex.
If you have been diagnosed with chlamydia you should get tested for all STIs including:

gonorrhoea
syphilis
HIV
"
Chronic fatigue syndrome,"The symptoms of the condition vary from person to person. There may be times when your symptoms improve and you’ll be able to do some normal everyday activities. At other times, symptoms may get worse, affecting your daily life.
If you experience new symptoms, talk to your GP or specialist as the new symptoms may be unrelated to ME/CFS. Women often find that symptoms worsen at different times in their menstrual cycle. Not everyone will experience all of the symptoms.
People with ME/CFS experience severe pain, fatigue and a range of other symptoms associated with PEM. This is the body and brain’s inability to recover after using even small amounts of energy.
Simple physical or mental activities, or combinations of activities, can leave people with ME/CFS feeling completely exhausted. It can also lead to an increase in other symptoms.
Other symptoms of ME/CFS include:

feeling generally unwell
pain
broken sleep
problems with concentration, thinking and memory (‘brain fog’)
speech and language problems, including word-finding difficulties
poor temperature control
dizziness
being very sensitive to light and sound
nausea
loss of appetite
muscle pain (myalgia)

Read more about the symptoms of ME/CFS
Frustration, anxiety, low mood and depression are sometimes experienced by people with ME/CFS because of the impact of the condition and its symptoms on their lives. This does not mean that ME/CFS is a mental health condition."
Chronic kidney disease,"Most people with CKD have no symptoms because the body can tolerate even a large reduction in kidney function.
In other words, we are born with a lot more kidney function than is necessary for survival. Kidney function is often sufficient if only 1 kidney is working. That is why people can give a kidney to someone needing a kidney transplant.
A change in kidney function is usually discovered through a routine blood or urine test. If you are diagnosed with kidney disease, your kidney function will be monitored with regular blood and urine tests, and treatment aims to keep any symptoms to a minimum.
If the kidneys continue to lose function and there is progression towards kidney failure (established renal failure or ERF), this will usually be tracked by blood tests and monitoring. If kidney failure does occur, the symptoms may include:

weight loss and poor appetite
swollen ankles, feet or hands (due to water retention) 
shortness of breath 
blood or protein in your urine (protein in your urine is not something you will notice as it can only be detected during a urine test) 
an increased need to urinate, particularly at night 
insomnia
itchy skin 
muscle cramps
high blood pressure (hypertension)
nausea 
erectile dysfunction in men (an inability to get or maintain an erection)

These are general symptoms and can be caused by many less serious conditions. Many of the symptoms above can be avoided if treatment begins at an early stage, before any symptoms appear.
If you are worried by any of these symptoms, arrange to see your GP."
Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia,"CLL doesn’t usually cause any symptoms early on and may only be picked up during a blood test carried out for another reason.
When symptoms develop, they may include:

getting infections often
anaemia – persistent tiredness, shortness of breath and pale skin
bleeding and bruising more easily than normal
a high temperature (fever)
night sweats
swollen glands in your neck, armpits or groin
swelling and discomfort in your tummy
unintentional weight loss

You should speak to your GP if you have any persistent or worrying symptoms. These symptoms can have other causes other than cancer, but it’s a good idea to get them checked out.
Read more about diagnosing CLL and complications of CLL.
As CLL progresses slowly and often has no symptoms at first, you may not need to be treated immediately.
If it’s caught early on, you’ll have regular check-ups over the following months or years to see if it’s getting any worse.
If CLL starts to cause symptoms, or isn’t diagnosed until later on, the main treatments are:

chemotherapy – where medication is taken as a tablet or given directly into a vein is used to destroy the cancerous cells
a stem cell or bone marrow transplant – where donated cells called stem cells are transplanted into your body so you start to produce healthy white blood cells

Treatment can’t usually cure CLL completely, but can slow its progression and lead to periods where there are no symptoms. Treatment may be repeated if the condition comes back.
Read more about treating CLL.
The outlook for CLL depends on how advanced it is when it’s diagnosed, how old you are when diagnosed, and your general health.
Younger, healthier people who are diagnosed when CLL is still in the early stages generally have the best outlook.
Although it can’t normally be cured, treatment can help control the condition for many years."
Chronic myeloid leukaemia,"In its early stages, chronic myeloid leukaemia usually causes no noticeable symptoms and it is often diagnosed during tests for a different condition.
When symptoms do develop, they are similar to those of many other illnesses and can include:

tiredness
frequent infections
unexplained weight loss
a feeling of bloating
less commonly, swollen lymph nodes – glands found in the neck and under your arms, which are usually painless

Chronic myeloid leukaemia can also cause swelling in your spleen (an organ that helps to filter impurities from your blood). This can cause a lump to appear on the left side of your abdomen, which may be painful when touched. A swollen spleen can also put pressure on your stomach, causing a lack of appetite and indigestion.
The symptoms of chronic myeloid leukaemia in its advanced stage will be much more noticeable and troublesome. They include:

severe fatigue
bone pain
night sweats
fever
easily bruised skin
"
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD),
Chronic pain,
Chronic pancreatitis,"The most common symptom of chronic pancreatitis is repeated episodes of abdominal (tummy) pain. Eventually, there may also be digestion problems.
The pain usually develops in the middle or left side of the abdomen and can sometimes travel along your back. It’s been described as a burning or shooting pain which comes and goes, but can last for several hours or days, in some cases.
Some people also experience symptoms of nausea and vomiting during the pain. As chronic pancreatitis progresses, the painful episodes may become more frequent and severe.
Although the pain sometimes occurs after eating a meal, there’s often no trigger.
Eventually, a constant mild to moderate pain can develop in the abdomen in between episodes of severe pain. This is most common in people who continue to drink alcohol after being diagnosed with chronic pancreatitis.
Some people who stop drinking alcohol and stop smoking may experience a reduction in the severity of their pain.
Additional symptoms can occur when the pancreas loses its ability to produce digestive juices, which help to break down food in the digestive system. The pancreas usually only loses these functions many years after the original symptoms started.
The absence of digestive juices makes it difficult for your digestive system to break down fats and certain proteins. This can cause your stools to become particularly smelly and greasy, and make them difficult to flush down the toilet.
You may also experience:

weight loss
loss of appetite
jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes)
symptoms of diabetes – such as feeling very thirsty, urinating frequently and feeling very tired
ongoing nausea and vomiting

Always visit your GP if you’re experiencing severe pain, as this is a warning sign that something is wrong.
You should also visit your GP if you develop symptoms of jaundice. Jaundice can have a range of causes other than pancreatitis, but it’s usually a sign that there’s something wrong with your digestive system.
You should also visit your GP if you develop persistent vomiting."
Cirrhosis,"There are usually few symptoms during the early stages of cirrhosis. Noticeable problems tend to develop as the liver becomes more damaged.
In early stage cirrhosis, the liver is able to function properly despite being damaged. As the condition progresses, symptoms tend to develop when functions of the liver are affected.
Symptoms of cirrhosis can include:

tiredness and weakness
loss of appetite
weight loss and muscle wasting
feeling sick (nausea) and vomiting
tenderness or pain around the liver area
tiny red lines (blood capillaries) on the skin above waist level
very itchy skin
yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes (jaundice)
a tendency to bleed and bruise more easily, such as frequent nosebleeds or bleeding gums
hair loss
fever and shivering attacks
swelling in the legs, ankles and feet due to a build-up of fluid (oedema)
swelling in your abdomen (tummy), due to a build-up of fluid known as ascites (severe cases can make you look heavily pregnant)

You may also notice changes in your personality, problems sleeping (insomnia), memory loss, confusion and difficulty concentrating. This is known as encephalopathy and occurs when toxins affect your brain because your liver is unable to remove them from your body.
In the later stages of cirrhosis, you may vomit blood or have tarry, black stools. This is because blood can’t flow through the liver properly, which causes an increase in blood pressure in the vein that carries blood from the gut to the liver (portal vein).
The increase in blood pressure forces blood through smaller, fragile vessels that line your stomach and gullet (varices). These can burst under high blood pressure, leading to internal bleeding, which is visible in vomit and/or stools.
Over time, the toxins that would normally be removed from the body by a healthy liver can cause multiple organ failure, followed by death.
You should see your GP if you have persistent signs and symptoms of cirrhosis.
Seek immediate medical help if you develop the following symptoms, particularly if you’ve been previously diagnosed with cirrhosis:

fever and shivering attacks
shortness of breath 
vomiting blood 
very dark or black tarry stools
periods of mental confusion or drowsiness
"
Clostridium difficile,"Symptoms of a C. difficile infection usually develop when you’re taking antibiotics, or when you’ve finished taking them within the last few weeks.
The most common symptoms are:

watery diarrhoea, which can be bloody
painful tummy cramps
feeling sick
signs of dehydration, such as a dry mouth, headaches and peeing less often than normal
a high temperature (fever) of above 38C (100.4F)
loss of appetite and weight loss

In some cases, serious complications can develop, such as damage to the bowel or severe dehydration, which may cause drowsiness, confusion, a rapid heart rate and fainting.
C. difficile mostly affects people who:

have been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics (antibiotics that work against several types of bacteria) or several different antibiotics at the same time, or those taking long-term antibiotics
have had to stay in a healthcare setting, such as a hospital or care home, for a long time
are over 65 years old
have certain underlying conditions, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), cancer or kidney disease
have a weakened immune system, which can be because of a condition such as diabetes or a side effect of a treatment such as chemotherapy or steroid medication
are taking a medication called a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) to reduce the amount of stomach acid they produce
have had surgery on their digestive system

Many C. difficile infections used to occur in places where many people take antibiotics and are in close contact with each other, such as hospitals and care homes.
However, strict infection control measures have helped to reduce this risk, and an increasing number of C. difficile infections now occur outside these settings.
Visiting your GP surgery with a possible C. difficile infection can put others at risk, so it’s best to phone your GP or NHS 111 if you’re concerned or feel you need advice.
Diarrhoea can be caused by a number of conditions and is a common side effect of antibiotics, so having diarrhoea while taking antibiotics doesn’t necessarily mean you have a C. difficile infection.
Your GP may suggest sending off a sample of your poo to confirm whether you have C. difficile. A blood test may also be carried out to help determine how severe the infection is, and sometimes you may need tests or scans in hospital to check if your bowel is damaged.
Your GP will decide whether you need hospital treatment (if you’re not already in hospital). If the infection is relatively mild, you may be treated at home.
If you’re in hospital, you might be moved to a room of your own during treatment to reduce the risk of the infection spreading to others.
Treatment for C. difficile can include:

stopping the antibiotics thought to be causing the infection, if possible – in mild cases, this may be the only treatment that’s needed
taking a 10 to 14-day course of antibiotics that are known to kill C. difficile bacteria
rarely, serious infections may require surgery to remove a damaged section of the bowel

C. difficile infections usually respond well to treatment, with most people making a full recovery in a week or two. However, the symptoms come back in around 1 in 5 cases and treatment may need to be repeated.
If you’re well enough to be treated at home, the following measures can help relieve your symptoms and prevent the infection spreading.
Your GP may contact you regularly to make sure you’re getting better. Phone them if your symptoms return after treatment finishes, as it may need to be repeated.
C. difficile bacteria are found in the digestive system of about 1 in every 30 healthy adults. The bacteria often live harmlessly because the other bacteria normally found in the bowel keep it under control.
However, some antibiotics can interfere with the balance of bacteria in the bowel, which can cause the C. difficile bacteria to multiply and produce toxins that make the person ill.
When this happens, C. difficile can spread easily to other people because the bacteria are passed out of the body in the person’s diarrhoea.
Once out of the body, the bacteria turn into resistant cells called spores. These can survive for long periods on hands, surfaces (such as toilets), objects and clothing unless they’re thoroughly cleaned, and can infect someone else if they get into their mouth.
Someone with a C. difficile infection is generally considered to be infectious until at least 48 hours after their symptoms have cleared up.
C. difficile infections can be passed on very easily. You can reduce your risk of picking it up or spreading it by practising good hygiene, both at home and in healthcare settings.
The following measures can help:

stay at home until at least 48 hours after your symptoms have cleared up
wash your hands regularly with soap and water, particularly after going to the toilet and before eating – use liquid rather than bar soap and don’t use flannels or nail brushes
clean contaminated surfaces – such as the toilet, flush handle, light switches and door handles – with a bleach-based cleaner after each use
don’t share towels and flannels
wash contaminated clothes and sheets separately from other washing at the highest possible temperature
when visiting someone in hospital, observe any visiting guidelines, avoid taking any children under the age of 12, and wash your hands with liquid soap and water when entering and leaving ward areas – don’t rely on alcohol hand gels, as they’re not effective against C. difficile
avoid visiting hospital if you’re feeling unwell or have recently had diarrhoea
"
Coeliac disease,"Coeliac disease can cause a wide range of symptoms in the digestive system and rest of the body.
Symptoms can develop at any age, but coeliac disease is most commonly diagnosed between the ages of 40 and 60 years.
More about the symptoms of coeliac disease or what is coeliac disease?"
Cold sore,"You may not have any symptoms when you first become infected with HSV (the primary infection).
An outbreak of cold sores may occur later and keep coming back (recurrent infection).
However, if the primary infection does cause symptoms, they can be quite severe.
Symptoms of the primary infection are most likely to develop in children younger than 5 years old. These include:

swollen and irritated gums with small, painful sores in and around the mouth – this is known as herpes simplex gingivostomatitis
sore throat and swollen glands
producing more saliva than normal
high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above
dehydration
feeling sick (nausea)
headaches

Herpes simplex gingivostomatitis usually affects young children, but adults can also develop it. It can last 7 to 14 days, with the sores taking up to 3 weeks to heal. However, gingivostomatitis doesn’t usually happen after the primary infection.
Symptoms of the primary infection are rare in adults but are similar to those experienced by children.
You’ll usually have a sore throat with or without swollen glands. You may also have bad breath (halitosis) and painful sores in and around your mouth. These can develop into ulcers with grey or yellow centres.
If you develop HSV at an early age, it may be triggered periodically in later life and can cause recurring bouts of cold sores. After the primary infection, the symptoms are usually reduced to just the cold sores themselves.
If you have cold sores you can get advice and treatment directly from a pharmacy.
Your pharmacist may recommend that you speak to your GP if required.
If you get cold sores, a pharmacist may recommend:

creams to ease pain and irritation
antiviral creams to speed up the healing time
cold sore patches to protect the skin while it heals

You can buy electronic devices from pharmacies that treat cold sores with light or lasers. Some people find these helpful, but there have not been many studies to confirm if they work.
If you regularly get cold sores, use antiviral creams as soon as you recognise the early tingling feeling. They do not always work after blisters appear.
If your cold sores are very large, painful and keep coming back, your GP may prescribe antiviral tablets.
Newborn babies, pregnant women and people with a weakened immune system who have cold sores may be referred to hospital for advice or treatment.
Cold sores are usually caused by the herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1).
In most cases, the virus is passed on in early childhood. For example, when a child is kissed by a family member or friend with a cold sore.
The virus passes through the skin and travels up the nerves, where it lies inactive (dormant) until it’s triggered at a later date.
Things that can trigger a cold sore outbreak include:

having another infection, such as a respiratory tract infection
having a high temperature (fever)
emotional upset or psychological stress
tiredness and fatigue
an injury to the affected area
menstruation (periods)
strong sunlight

However, in many cases, there’s no obvious trigger for an outbreak.
Sometimes, cold sores can be caused by the herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2).
This can happen after having oral sex with someone who has genital herpes, which is usually caused by HSV-2.
In genital herpes, painful blisters develop on your genitals and the surrounding area.
It’s not possible to prevent infection with the herpes simplex virus or prevent outbreaks of cold sores. However, there are things you can do to minimise the spread of infection.
Cold sores are at their most contagious when they burst (rupture), but remain contagious until they’re completely healed. Avoid close contact with others until your cold sore has completely healed and disappeared.
However, there’s no need to stay away from work or miss school if you or your child have a cold sore.
Cold sores are usually mild, but may cause complications in rare cases. People with weak immune systems caused by illness or treatments such as chemotherapy are particularly at risk of complications.
Dehydration sometimes occurs if drinking fluids becomes painful. Young children are particularly at risk of becoming dehydrated.
Other complications of cold sores include:

skin infections – these often happen if the virus comes into contact with broken skin, such as a cut or graze, or a skin condition such as eczema
herpetic whitlow (whitlow finger) – this causes painful sores and blisters to appear on and around your fingers
herpetic keratoconjunctivitis – this causes swelling and irritation (inflammation) of your eye area and sores to develop on your eyelids
"
Coma,
Common cold,"The main symptoms of a cold include:

a sore throat
a blocked or runny nose
sneezing
a cough
a hoarse voice
generally feeling unwell

Less common symptoms of a cold include:

high temperature (fever) – this is usually about 37°C to 39°C (98.6°F to 102.2°F)
a headache
earache – severe earache may be a sign of a middle ear infection
muscle aches
loss of taste and smell
mild irritation of your eyes
a feeling of pressure in your ears and face

Speak to a pharmacist if you have a cold and would like advice and treatment.
Find your local pharmacy
There’s no cure for a cold, but there are things you can do to look after yourself at home. You should begin to feel better in about 1 to 2 weeks.
Always read the leaflet that comes with your medicine before taking it. Follow the recommended dosage instructions. If you’re not sure which treatments are suitable for you or your child, speak to a pharmacist for advice.
Be careful not to use cough and cold medicines if you’re taking paracetamol and ibuprofen tablets. Cough and cold medicines often also contain paracetamol and ibuprofen so it can be easy to take more than the recommended dose.
A person can start spreading a cold from a few days before their symptoms start until their symptoms have gone.
You can catch the virus from an infectious person by:

touching an object or surface contaminated by infected droplets and then touching your mouth, nose or eyes
touching the skin of someone who has the infected droplets on their skin and then touching your mouth, nose or eyes
breathing in tiny droplets of fluid that contain the cold virus – these are launched into the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes

Different viruses can cause a cold. It’s possible to have different colds one after the other, as each one may be caused by a different virus.
It can sometimes be difficult to tell if you have a cold or flu, as the symptoms can be similar. The main differences are that flu symptoms:

come on quickly
usually include a headache, high temperature (fever) and sore muscles
make you feel too unwell to continue your usual activities

Cold symptoms:

come on slowly
mainly affect your nose and throat
are fairly mild, so you can still get around and are usually well enough to go to work

Colds usually clear up without causing any further problems. But the infection can sometimes spread to your chest, ears or sinuses."
Congenital heart disease,"The symptoms of acyanotic heart disease include:

severe tiredness
palpitations
chest pain
shortness of breath (particularly during activities such as climbing the stairs)

There are some symptoms that are present in both cyanotic and acyanotic heart disease.
These include:

poor appetite and feeding difficulties
sweating, particularly when a baby is feeding
delayed growth

Children with acyanotic heart disease are usually underweight, and children with cyanotic heart disease are usually underweight and small for their age."
Conjunctivitis,"Conjunctivitis usually causes symptoms in both eyes like:

inflammation
redness
itching
a burning or gritty feeling
watering
pus that sticks to the eyelashes
"
Constipation,"When you’re constipated, passing stools becomes more difficult and less frequent than usual.
Normal bowel habits vary from person to person. Some adults go to the toilet more than once a day, whereas others may only go every 3 or 4 days. Similarly, some infants pass stools several times a day, while others only pass them a few times a week.
If you or your child pass stools less than usual, it could be a sign of constipation.
It may also be more difficult to pass stools and you may feel unable to empty your bowel completely. Your stools may appear dry, hard and lumpy, as well as abnormally large or small.
Other symptoms of constipation can include:

stomach ache and cramps 
feeling bloated
feeling sick
loss of appetite

As well as infrequent or irregular bowel movements, a child with constipation may also have any of the following symptoms:

loss of appetite
a lack of energy
being irritable, angry or unhappy
foul-smelling wind and stools
stomach pain and discomfort
soiling their clothes
generally feeling unwell
"
Coronary heart disease,"The main symptoms of coronary heart disease are:

chest pain (angina)
shortness of breath
pain throughout the body
feeling faint
feeling sick (nausea)

Further information is available on the impact of heart disease on women
Many different tests may be used to diagnose coronary heart disease, including:

CT coronary angiography (CTCA)
coronary angiography
electrocardiogram (ECG)
thallium scan (myocardial perfusion scintigraphy)
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)

There are various risk factors for heart disease, some of which you have control over and others that you don’t.
Uncontrollable risk factors for heart disease include:

age
family history of heart disease or stroke
ethnicity
being post-menopausal

Your risk can also be increased by certain lifestyle factors. These are sometimes called controllable risk factors. For example, your diet, level of physical activity and smoking habits.
You can make lifestyle changes to reduce your risk of heart disease, including:

eating a balanced diet
weight management
keeping active and exercising regularly
stopping smoking

If you’ve been diagnosed with some other health conditions, you might also be at increased risk of heart disease. These conditions include:

hypertension (high blood pressure)
high cholesterol
type 2 diabetes
polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)
inflammatory diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis

You might find support groups useful if you:

have a heart condition
have had a heart condition in the past
are caring for someone with a heart condition

Your GP or specialist should be able to provide you with details about your nearest support group. You can also search Scotland’s Services Directory.
Information and support for people living with a heart condition is also provided by:

The British Heart Foundation

"
Coronavirus (COVID-19),"Symptoms of coronavirus include:

high temperature, fever or chills
feeling generally unwell
continuous cough
loss of, or change in, your normal sense of taste or smell
shortness of breath
unexplained tiredness, lack of energy
muscle aches or pains that are not due to exercise
not wanting to eat or not feeling hungry
headache that’s unusual or longer lasting than usual
sore throat, stuffy or runny nose
diarrhoea
feeling sick or being sick

You might continue to have a cough or feel tired after your other symptoms have improved. This does not mean that you’re still infectious.
Antibiotics will not relieve your symptoms or speed up your recovery.
It’s particularly important to get help if you’re at increased risk of becoming more unwell from coronavirus such as if you’re pregnant, aged 60 or over, or have a weakened immune system.
Complete our self-help guide to check your symptoms and find out what to do next.
There are things you can do to reduce the spread of infection if you have symptoms or have tested positive.
To prevent the spread of infection, you should stay at home and avoid contact with other people if you’re unwell. When you no longer have a fever (if you had one) and don’t need medicine to control your fever, you can return to normal activities. For example, work, school, and social events. There’s no specific time limit you need to avoid contact with others. You can use 48 hours as a rough guide.
If you have respiratory symptoms:

stay away from people at increased risk of becoming more unwell from coronavirus
do not visit hospitals or care homes

In older adult care homes, residents who have tested positive for coronavirus should self-isolate for at least 5 days and until they’ve been fever-free for at least 48 hours without taking medicine to control their temperature.
Respiratory infections are common in children and young people, particularly during the winter months. Symptoms can be caused by several respiratory infections including the common cold, coronavirus and RSV.
Children and young people with mild symptoms who are otherwise well can continue to attend their education setting. Mild symptoms include a runny nose, sore throat, or slight cough.
If a child or young person aged 18 or under tests positive or has respiratory symptoms, they should stay at home. When they no longer have a fever (if they had one), and don’t need medicine to control the fever, they can return to normal activities. There’s no specific time limit they need to avoid contact with others. You can use 48 hours as a rough guide.
Children and young people tend to be infectious for less time than adults.
For most children and young people, these illnesses will not be serious. They’ll soon recover following rest and plenty of fluids.
Very few children and young people with respiratory infections become seriously unwell.
Children and young people who usually go to school, college or childcare and who live with someone who has a positive coronavirus test result should continue to attend as normal.

Coronavirus (COVID-19): Longer-term effects (long COVID),
Costochondritis,"The main symptom of costochondritis is chest pain that appears centrally. The pain doesn’t usually spread across the chest or into the arms.
The pain may be made worse by:

certain positions or activities, like wearing a seatbelt or hugging someone
deep breathing
coughing and sneezing

Modifying your activities while you recover may help reduce your symptoms."
Cough,
Crohn’s disease,"The symptoms of Crohn’s disease vary. They depend on which part of the digestive system is inflamed.
Common symptoms include:

recurring diarrhoea
abdominal pain and cramping, which is usually worse after eating
extreme tiredness (fatigue)
unintended weight loss
blood and mucus in your poo

You may have long periods without symptoms, or very mild symptoms. This is known as remission. This may be followed by periods where the symptoms are particularly troublesome. These are known as flare-ups or relapses.
Less common symptoms include:

a high temperature (fever) of 38°C (100°F) or above
feeling sick (nausea)
being sick (vomiting)
joint pain and swelling (arthritis)
inflammation and irritation of the eyes (uveitis)
areas of painful, red and swollen skin – most often the legs
mouth ulcers
anal pain and discharge due to perianal Crohn’s

Children with Crohn’s disease may grow at a slower rate than expected."
Croup,"Children with croup have a barking cough that sounds like a seal. They’ll make a harsh sound, known as stridor, when they breathe in. Stridor is often most noticeable when the child cries or coughs. They may also have a hoarse voice and find it difficult to breathe because their airway is blocked.
Some children have cold-like symptoms for a few days before developing croup symptoms. Croup symptoms usually only last for a few days and are often worse at night. But they can occasionally last up to 2 weeks.
Croup can usually be diagnosed by a GP. They’ll check your child’s symptoms, particularly the sound of their cough. If you can, record the noise your child is making on your phone so your GP can hear it. This can be helpful if your child only coughs at night.
Your GP may also:

check your child’s temperature
ask whether your child has recently had a cold or viral infection
do a pulse oximetry test to check your child’s oxygen levels (this involves clipping a sensor onto your child’s earlobe or finger – it does not hurt)
rule out other conditions with more tests

Your GP will decide whether your child needs to go to hospital or whether their croup is safe to treat at home.
You should not try to check your child’s throat yourself. It could trigger a spasm (sudden narrowing) of the airway. This could make breathing even more difficult.
Most cases of croup are mild and can be treated at home.
Sitting your child upright and comforting them if they are distressed is important. This is because crying may make symptoms worse. Your child should also drink plenty of fluids to prevent dehydration.
Usually, your child will be prescribed medication to help reduce the swelling in their throat. The medication is a single dose of an oral corticosteroid called dexamethasone or prednisolone. Side effects of these medications can include restlessness, vomiting, upset stomach and headache.
Steam treatment is not recommended.
You should seek urgent medical advice if you notice your child’s symptoms getting worse.
Children’s paracetamol can ease pain and may help lower your child’s temperature if they have a fever.
Children under 16 years of age should not be given aspirin.
Speak to your pharmacist or GP if you are unsure about what type of pain relief is right for your child.
Do not use cough medicines or decongestants. These do not help ease the symptoms of croup. These treatments often have drowsy side effects, which can be dangerous when a child has breathing difficulties.
In severe cases of croup, treatment in hospital may be needed. This might include your child being given adrenaline or oxygen.
Commonly, croup is caused by a virus. Several viruses can cause croup but in most cases it is the parainfluenza virus.
The virus can be passed on by close contact with infected people, as well as contaminated objects and surfaces. It’s often spread by breathing in droplets from infected coughs or sneezes.
Other viruses can also cause croup. These include:

influenza A and B (flu viruses)
the measles virus, in children who have not been immunised against measles
the rhinovirus (common cold virus)
enteroviruses
the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), which can cause severe breathing problems and pneumonia in babies

Less common causes of croup include:

breathing in a small object such as a peanut or a pen cap (inhaled foreign body)
inflammation of the epiglottis (the flap at the base of the tongue that keeps food from going into the windpipe)
a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis), for example to certain foods
breathing in irritants such as chemicals
acid leaking back out of the stomach and into the throat (acid reflux)
"
Cystic fibrosis,"Symptoms of cystic fibrosis tend to start in early childhood, although they can sometimes develop very soon after birth, or may not be obvious until adulthood.
Some of the main symptoms of cystic fibrosis can include:

recurring chest infections
difficulty putting on weight
frequent, wet-sounding coughs
diarrhoea
occasional wheezing and shortness of breath

People with the condition can also develop a number of related conditions, including diabetes, thin, weakened bones (osteoporosis) and liver problems.
Read more about the symptoms of cystic fibrosis"
Cystitis,"It can be difficult to tell whether a child has cystitis, because the symptoms can be vague and young children cannot easily communicate how they feel.
Possible symptoms of cystitis in young children may include:

a high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above
weakness and tiredness
irritability 
reduced appetite
vomiting

Children with cystitis can sometimes also have symptoms usually found in adults, such as pain when peeing, peeing more often than normal and pain in their tummy.
You should see your GP if you or your child have symptoms of cystitis for the first time.
Cystitis isn’t usually a cause for serious concern, but the symptoms can be similar to several other conditions, so it’s important to get a proper diagnosis.
If you’re a woman who has had cystitis before, you don’t necessarily need to see your GP again. Cystitis is very common in women and mild cases often get better on their own. Speak to a pharmacist if you need any advice about treating cystitis.
However, you should see your GP if your symptoms are severe or don’t start to get better in a few days, you get cystitis frequently, or you’re pregnant.
Children and men should always be seen by a GP if they have symptoms of cystitis, as the condition is less common and could be more serious in these groups."
Deafblindness,
Deep vein thrombosis,"Swelling is one of the main symptoms of DVT. It may not always be easy to notice. Swelling can happen in any part of your leg, but usually happens in the back of the leg.
Other symptoms of DVT include:

tenderness
throbbing pain – if the clot is in your leg, pain is usually in the calf or thigh when walking or standing up, and pain may be worse when you bend your foot upwards towards your knee
a heavy ache in the affected area
red or darkened skin around the painful area – depending on your skin tone this may be difficult to see
warm skin around the painful area
swollen veins that are hard or sore when you touch them

These symptoms can also happen in your arm or tummy if that’s where the blood clot is.
Anyone can develop DVT, but the risk increases with age. You’re also more likely to get DVT if you:

are inactive for long periods – for example, after an operation or during a long journey
have had DVT, a pulmonary embolism or a blood clot before
have a family history of DVT, pulmonary embolism or blood clots
you have damaged blood vessels – for example, due to injury or a condition like varicose veins
are pregnant or have given birth in the last 6 weeks
take the contraceptive pill or hormone replacement therapy (HRT)
are receiving chemotherapy or radiotherapy
have cancer
have heart or lung disease
smoke
are overweight or obese

Sometimes DVT can happen for no obvious reason.
If your doctor thinks that you have DVT, you will need to have some tests. These include a specific blood test called a D dimer, and/or an ultrasound. An ultrasound scan shows if blood is flowing normally through the veins or if there are any clots.
You may also need an X-ray of the vein (venogram). For this, you’ll be injected with a dye to show where the clot is.
There are a few ways to treat DVT. Your healthcare team will decide the best way to treat your symptoms.
Anticoagulant medicines are used to treat DVT. These can include warfarin or apixaban.
Anticoagulants are often referred to as “blood-thinning” medicines, but they don’t actually thin the blood. They alter proteins within it, which prevents clots forming so easily.
You may need to take an anticoagulant medicine like warfarin for at least 3 months.
You’ll be prescribed compression socks to treat DVT. These are knee-high elastic socks that help your blood circulation.
Compression socks can improve the symptoms of DVT, including pain and swelling. They can also help to prevent complications of DVT.
Once you’ve been prescribed compression socks, your healthcare team may advise you to walk regularly. This can help to prevent symptoms of DVT and reduce or prevent complications.
Some people may need surgery to treat DVT.
You may need to be fitted with an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter to treat your symptoms. These are small mesh devices that can be placed in a vein. They can be used to help prevent blood clots developing.
If you have DVT in your leg, you may be advised to raise it whenever you’re resting. This helps to relieve pressure in the veins of the calf and stops blood and fluid pooling in the calf.
When raising your leg, make sure your foot is higher than your hip. To do this, you can put a cushion underneath your leg whilst you’re lying down.
You can help reduce your risk of getting DVT by making changes to your lifestyle.
Find out more about healthy living
If you need to go into hospital for surgery, your healthcare team will assess your risk of developing DVT.
If you’re at risk of developing DVT, you may be given treatment to prevent it. For example, you may need to wear compression socks or take medicine.
You may need to continue these treatments after you leave hospital as there’s still a risk that you could develop DVT.
Whilst in hospital, try to move as much as you can. Your healthcare team may give you exercises to do.
If you need to travel a long distance, or for more than 3 hours, there are steps you can take to help avoid getting DVT.
You should:

drink plenty of water
practice some leg exercises, such as flexing your ankles
take regular short walking breaks
avoid drinking lots of alcohol
wear compression socks

Speak to a healthcare professional if you’re planning any long-distance travel and have had DVT in the past, or if you’re at risk of it.
DVT can be very serious as blood clots can travel to the lungs. This is called a pulmonary embolism. A pulmonary embolism can be life-threatening and needs to be treated quickly.
If you’ve had a DVT, you can develop long-term symptoms like pain and swelling. This is known as post-thrombotic syndrome."
Degenerative Cervical Myelopathy,"It’s common to experience one or multiple symptoms.
The most common symptoms include:

pain or stiffness in the neck
tingling or numbness in the arms or legs (often starting in fingertips or toes) or less commonly in the body
change or loss in the manual coordination or dexterity in the hands (e.g. fastening buttons or tying shoelaces)
pain, weakness or heaviness in the arms or legs
imbalance or feeling unsteady which may lead to falls
difficulty walking
change of bladder or bowel function, such as increased urgency or incontinence

Many people have a combination of neck pain, arm pain, numbness and weakness. These symptoms can be distressing, but don’t necessarily require urgent medical attention.
Sometimes symptoms can progress suddenly, early recognition and treatment can prevent further deterioration.
If you feel that your symptoms are gradually worsening over time you should contact your healthcare professional to discuss this.
In order for degenerative cervical myelopathy to be diagnosed you’ll need an assessment from a healthcare professional.
They’ll ask you questions about your symptoms and then carry out a physical examination. This may include checking your strength, movement and nerve function.
Depending on the examination you may then be offered an MRI scan.
You may sometimes need to have a further examination to rule out other causes of these symptoms."
Dehydration,"Dehydration can be mild, moderate or severe, depending on how much of your body weight is lost through fluids.
Two early signs of dehydration are thirst and dark-coloured urine. This is the body’s way of trying to increase water intake and decrease water loss.
Other symptoms may include:

dizziness or light-headedness
headache 
tiredness
dry mouth, lips and eyes
passing small amounts of urine infrequently (less than three or four times a day)

Dehydration can also lead to a loss of strength and stamina. It’s a main cause of heat exhaustion.
You should be able to reverse dehydration at this stage by drinking more fluids.
If dehydration is ongoing (chronic), it can affect your kidney function and increase the risk of kidney stones. It can also lead to muscle damage and constipation.
See your GP if your symptoms continue despite drinking fluids, or if you suspect that your baby or toddler is dehydrated.
You should also contact your GP if your baby has had six or more episodes of diarrhoea in the past 24 hours, or if they have vomited three times or more in the past 24 hours.
If dehydration is suspected, you may be given a blood test or a urine test to check the balance of salts (sodium and potassium) in your body.
If dehydration is left untreated, it can become severe.
Severe dehydration is a medical emergency and requires immediate medical attention.
Contact your GP, out-of-hours service or NHS 24 111 service straight away if you have any of the following symptoms:

feeling unusually tired (lethargic) or confused, and you think you may be dehydrated
dizziness when you stand up that doesn’t go away after a few seconds
not passing urine for eight hours
a weak pulse
a rapid pulse
fits (seizures)
a low level of conciousness

If severe dehydration is not treated immediately, it can lead to complications. This level of dehydration needs hospital treatment and you will be put on a drip to restore the substantial loss of fluids.
A baby may be dehydrated if they have:

a sunken soft spot (fontanelle) on their head
few or no tears when they cry
a dry mouth
fewer wet nappies
dark yellow urine
drowsiness
fast breathing
cold and blotchy-looking hands and feet

Read about how to treat dehydration in babies"
Delirium,"People with delirium may experience symptoms that include:

being confused (or more confused than normal)
being sleepy and less responsive
being very agitated or restless
a change in sleeping pattern (like being awake at night and sleeping during the day)
suspiciousness or a loss of trust
seeing or hearing things that aren’t real

Sometimes these symptoms are worse in the evenings or overnight.
Most delirium lasts a few days but in some cases it can persist for weeks or even months.
Delirium can continue even when all triggers have been addressed. In this situation, you should get ongoing supportive care and help. In other cases, the delirium will slowly improve.
Unfortunately, not all patients recover to the same mental function they had before their delirium."
Dementia,
Dental abscess,"Symptoms of an abscess in your tooth or gum may include:

an intense, throbbing pain in the affected tooth or gum that may come on suddenly and gets gradually worse
pain that spreads to your ear, jaw and neck on the same side as the affected tooth or gum
pain that’s worse when lying down, which may disturb your sleep
redness and swelling in your face
a tender, discoloured and/or loose tooth
shiny, red and swollen gums
sensitivity to hot or cold food and drink
bad breath and/or an unpleasant taste in your mouth

If the infection spreads, you may also develop a high temperature (fever) and feel generally unwell. In severe cases, you may find it hard to fully open your mouth and have difficulty swallowing or breathing.
You should see a dentist as soon as possible if you think you have a dental abscess. Avoid visiting your GP, as there is little they can do to help.
You can get help from:

your registered dentist – if it’s out of hours, they should have an answerphone message with details of how to access out-of-hours dental treatment
NHS 24 111 service – who can give you details of dental services in your area
your local clinical commissioning group (CCG) – who can tell you the phone number of your local dental access helpline
your local accident and emergency (A&E) department – if there are no other options or you’re having difficulty breathing

You may have to pay for emergency NHS dental treatment, depending on your circumstances. Read about NHS dental charges.
While you’re waiting to see a dentist, painkillers can help control your pain.
Ibuprofen is the preferred painkiller for dental abscesses, but if you’re unable to take it for medical reasons, you can take paracetamol instead. Aspirin shouldn’t be given to children under 16.
If one painkiller doesn’t relieve the pain, taking both paracetamol and ibuprofen at the doses shown in the medicine leaflet may help. This is safe for adults, but not for children under 16.
It may also help to:

avoid hot or cold food and drink if it makes the pain worse
try eating cool, soft foods if possible, using the opposite side of your mouth
use a soft toothbrush and temporarily avoid flossing around the affected tooth

These measures can help relieve your symptoms temporarily, but you shouldn’t use them to delay getting help from a dentist.
Dental abscesses are treated by removing the source of the infection and draining away the pus.
Depending on the location of the abscess and how severe the infection is, possible treatments include:

removing the affected tooth (extraction) – this may be necessary if root canal treatment isn’t possible
root canal treatment – a procedure to remove the abscess from the root of an affected tooth before filling and sealing it
incision and drainage – where a small cut (incision) is made in the gum to drain the abscess (this is usually only a temporary solution and further treatment may be needed)

Local anaesthetic will usually be used to numb your mouth for these procedures. More extensive operations may be carried out under general anaesthetic (where you’re asleep).
Antibiotics aren’t routinely prescribed for dental abscesses, but may be used if the infection spreads or is particularly severe.
Your mouth is full of bacteria, which form a sticky film on your teeth called plaque.
If you don’t keep your teeth clean, acids produced by the bacteria in plaque can damage your teeth and gums, leading to tooth decay or gum disease.
The following can increase your chances of developing a dental abscess:

poor oral hygiene – plaque can build-up on your teeth if you don’t floss and brush your teeth regularly
consuming lots of sugary or starchy food and drink – these can encourage the growth of bacteria in plaque and may lead to decay that can result in an abscess
an injury or previous surgery to your teeth or gums – bacteria can get into any damaged parts of the teeth or gums
having a weakened immune system – this includes people with certain underlying health conditions, such as diabetes, and those having treatment, including steroid medication or chemotherapy 

You can reduce your risk of developing dental abscesses by keeping your teeth and gums as healthy as possible.
To do this, you should:

use floss or an interdental brush at least once a day to clean between your teeth and under the gum line
brush your teeth with a fluoride toothpaste twice a day – spending at least two minutes each time
avoid rinsing your mouth with water or mouthwash after brushing because this washes the protective toothpaste away – just spit out any excess toothpaste
cut down on sugary and starchy food and drinks – particularly between meals or shortly before going to bed
visit your dentist regularly – your dentist can suggest how often you should have a check-up, based on your oral health

Depression,"Symptoms of depression can be very different from person to person. However, as a general rule, if you are depressed you feel hopeless, sad and lacking interest in things that used to make you feel happy.
Depression symptoms are bad enough to interfere with work, social life and family life, and can persist for weeks or months.
Doctors describe depression in one of three ways, depending on how serious it is:

mild depression – it has some impact on daily life
moderate depression – it has a significant impact on your daily life
severe depression – this makes it nearly impossible to get through your life day to day

A few people with severe depression may have symptoms of psychotic depression.
Below is a list of depression symptoms – it’s unlikely that one person would have all of them.

continuous sadness or low mood
losing interest in things
losing motivation
not getting any enjoyment in life
feeling tearful
feeling guilty
feeling anxious
feeling irritable
finding it hard to make decisions
feeling intolerant of other people
feeling helpless
feeling hopeless
low self-esteem
feeling worried
thinking about suicide
thinking about harming yourself


speaking or moving slower than usual
aches and pains that can’t be explained
losing, or sometimes gaining, appetite or weight
constipation
loss of interest in sex
disturbed sleep (having trouble falling asleep, for example, or waking up very early)
loss of energy
changes in your menstrual cycle (the time of the month when you get your period)

Social symptoms are common too. These include:

avoiding talking to or spending time with your friends
taking part in fewer social activities
neglecting interests and hobbies
doing poorly at work
difficulties with your family or home life

It’s not always possible to tell that you’re having symptoms of depression right away – it can start and progress gradually. A lot of people don’t realise they’re ill and try to carry on and cope with their symptoms. Sometimes it takes a friend or family member to notice that there’s a problem.
Depression and grief have a lot of the same features, and it can be hard to tell them apart. However, they’re different in many important ways. Depression is an illness – grief is a completely natural response to loss.
If you’re grieving, you may find your feelings of sadness and loss come and go, but it’s still possible to enjoy things in life and look forward to the future.
People with depression feel sad persistently, find it difficult to be positive about the future, and don’t get enjoyment from anything.
There are different types of depression, and there are some conditions where depression is a symptom. These conditions include:

Bipolar disorder – people with bipolar disorder, which is also known as “manic depression”, experience times of depression, where the symptoms are similar to clinical depression. They also go through phases when they have excessively high moods (known as “mania”). Bouts of mania can include harmful behaviour like unsafe sex, spending sprees and gambling.
Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is also called “winter depression”. It’s depression that is related to weather, usually winter, so it happens seasonally.
Postnatal depression happens to some women after they’ve had a baby. It’s treated similarly to other types of depression, with antidepressant medication and talking therapy.

Dermatitis herpetiformis,"People with DH can have:

red, raised patches often with blisters that burst with scratching
severe itching and often stinging

The rash can affect any area of the skin but is most commonly seen on the:

elbows
knees
buttocks

The rash usually occurs on both sides of the body, for example on both elbows.
Most people with DH will have the same kind of gut damage seen with coeliac disease, but may not complain of gut symptoms like:

diarrhoea
constipation
stomach pain
bloating

Just over half (60%) of people with DH don’t have gut symptoms."
Diabetes,"The main symptoms of diabetes are:

feeling very thirsty
urinating more frequently than usual, particularly at night
feeling very tired
weight loss and loss of muscle bulk
itching around the penis or vagina, or frequent episodes of thrush
cuts or wounds that heal slowly
blurred vision

Type 1 diabetes can develop quickly over a few hours or even days.
Many people have type 2 diabetes for years without realising because the early symptoms tend to be general.
The amount of glucose in the blood is controlled by a hormone called insulin, which is produced by the pancreas (a gland behind the stomach).
When food is digested and enters your bloodstream, insulin moves glucose out of the blood and into cells, where it’s broken down to produce energy.
However, if you have diabetes, your body is unable to break down glucose into energy. This is because there’s either not enough insulin to move the glucose, or the insulin produced doesn’t work properly.
In type 1 diabetes, the body’s immune system attacks and destroys the cells that produce insulin. As insulin production decreases until no more is produced, your glucose levels increase, which can seriously damage the body’s organs.
Type 1 diabetes usually develops before the age of 40, often during the teenage years.
Type 1 diabetes is less common than type 2 diabetes. In the UK, it affects about 10% of all adults with diabetes.
If you’re diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, you’ll need insulin injections for the rest of your life.
You’ll also need to pay close attention to certain aspects of your lifestyle and health to ensure your blood glucose levels stay balanced.
For example, you’ll need to eat healthily, take regular exercise and carry out regular blood tests.
Read more about living with type 1 diabetes
Type 2 diabetes is where the body doesn’t produce enough insulin, or the body’s cells don’t react to insulin. This is known as insulin resistance.
If you’re diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, you may be able to control your symptoms simply by eating a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and monitoring your blood glucose levels.
However, as type 2 diabetes is a progressive condition, you may eventually need medication, usually in the form of tablets.
Type 2 diabetes is often associated with obesity. Obesity-related diabetes is sometimes referred to as maturity-onset diabetes because it’s more common in older people.
Read more about living with type 2 diabetes
Everyone with diabetes aged 12 or over should be invited to have their eyes screened once a year by the national diabetes retinal screening service.
If you have diabetes, your eyes are at risk from diabetic retinopathy, a condition that can lead to sight loss if it’s not treated.
Screening, which involves a half-hour check to examine the back of the eyes, is a way of detecting the condition early so it can be treated more effectively.
Read more about diabetic eye screening
During pregnancy, all women need to make more insulin. In some women this doesn’t happen and blood glucose levels rise – typically in the middle of pregnancy onwards.
Diabetes diagnosed in pregnancy is known as gestational diabetes.
Risk of gestational diabetes is increased with the same risk factors for type 2 diabetes (increased weight, at risk ethnicity and family history of diabetes), but also if you have given birth to a baby in the past who was bigger than expected.
For most women with gestational diabetes, blood glucose levels will return to normal after pregnancy. Although you will have an increased risk of developing diabetes in later life.
If you’re worried about gestational diabetes then discuss this with your midwife.
Blood glucose control is also very important for women with diabetes before pregnancy (type 1, type 2 or other kinds). If you’re planning a pregnancy or are in the early stages of pregnancy, it’s important to discuss this with your GP, midwife or hospital clinic.
In addition to Type 1, Type 2 and gestational diabetes, there are a range of other types of diabetes.
These types of diabetes are much rarer, with about 2% of people having them. The rare types of diabetes include:

different types of monogenic diabetes
cystic fibrosis-related diabetes
diabetes caused by rare syndromes
diabetes caused by certain medications such as steroids and antipsychotics
diabetes caused by surgery or hormonal imbalances

Unfortunately, many people with rarer types of diabetes are misdiagnosed leading to delays in getting the right treatment.

Diabetic retinopathy,"You won’t usually notice diabetic retinopathy in the early stages, as it doesn’t tend to have any obvious symptoms until it’s more advanced.
However, early signs of the condition can be picked up by taking photographs of the eyes during diabetic eye screening.
Contact your optician immediately if you experience:

gradually worsening vision
sudden vision loss
shapes floating in your field of vision (floaters)
blurred or patchy vision
eye pain or redness

These symptoms don’t necessarily mean you have diabetic retinopathy, but it’s important to get them checked out. Don’t wait until your next screening appointment.
Everyone with diabetes who is 12 years old or over is invited for eye screening once a year.
Screening is offered because:

diabetic retinopathy doesn’t tend to cause any symptoms in the early stages
the condition can cause permanent blindness if not diagnosed and treated promptly
screening can detect problems in your eyes before they start to affect your vision
if problems are caught early, treatment can help prevent or reduce vision loss

The screening test involves examining the back of the eyes and taking photographs. Depending on your result, you may be advised to return for another appointment a year later, attend more regular appointments, or discuss treatment options with a specialist.
Read more about diabetic eye screening
You can reduce your risk of developing diabetic retinopathy, or help prevent it getting worse, by:

controlling your blood sugar, blood pressure and cholesterol levels
taking your diabetes medication as prescribed
attending all your screening appointments
getting medical advice quickly if you notice any changes to your vision
maintaining a healthy weight, eating a healthy, balanced diet, exercising regularly and stopping smoking

Read more about how to prevent diabetic retinopathy.
Treatment for diabetic retinopathy is only necessary if screening detects significant problems that mean your vision is at risk.
If the condition hasn’t reached this stage, the above advice on managing your diabetes is recommended.
The main treatments for more advanced diabetic retinopathy are:

laser treatment
injections of medication into your eyes
an operation to remove blood or scar tissue from your eyes

Diarrhoea,
Discoid eczema,"Discoid eczema causes distinctive circular or oval patches of eczema.
The patches can appear anywhere on the body, including the:

lower legs
forearms
trunk (torso)
hands
feet

The face and scalp are not normally affected.
The first sign of discoid eczema is usually a group of small red spots or bumps on the skin. These then quickly join up to form larger pink, red or brown patches that can range from a few millimetres to several centimetres in size.
Initially, these patches are often swollen, blistered (covered with small fluid-filled pockets) and ooze fluid. They also tend to be very itchy, particularly at night.
Over time, the patches may become dry, crusty, cracked and flaky. The centre of the patch also sometimes clears, leaving a ring of discoloured skin that can be mistaken for ringworm.
You may just have one patch of discoid eczema, but most people have several patches. The skin between the patches is often dry.
Patches of discoid eczema can last for weeks, months or even years if not treated, and they can keeping recurring – often in the same area that was affected previously.
Occasionally, areas of skin affected by discoid eczema can be left permanently discoloured after the condition has cleared up.
Patches of discoid eczema can sometimes become infected. Signs of an infection can include:

the patches oozing a lot of fluid
a yellow crust developing over the patches
the skin around the patches becoming red, hot, swollen, and tender or painful
feeling sick
chills
a general sense of feeling unwell

You should see your GP or pharmacist if you think you may have discoid eczema, as the condition can take a long time to improve without treatment and it may keep recurring.
You should also seek medical advice if you think your skin may be infected, as you may need to use antibiotic cream or, in very severe cases, take antibiotics tablets.
Read more about diagnosing discoid eczema."
Diverticular disease and diverticulitis,"Symptoms of diverticular disease and diverticulitis include abdominal pain, bloating and a change in normal bowel habits.
If diverticula have been discovered during a camera test for another reason (colonoscopy) or during a CT scan, you may be worried about what this means.
However, if you have never had abdominal pain or bouts of diarrhoea, there is a 70% to 80% chance that you will never have any symptoms from them.
Diverticula are extremely common over the age of 70 and they do not increase your risk of cancer. It’s thought that a high-fibre diet is likely to reduce the risk of any symptoms developing.
The most common symptom of diverticular disease is intermittent (stop-start) pain in your lower abdomen (stomach), usually in the lower left-hand side.
The pain is often worse when you are eating, or shortly afterwards. Passing stools and breaking wind (flatulence) may help relieve the pain.
Other long-term symptoms of diverticular disease include:

a change in your normal bowel habits, such as constipation or diarrhoea, or episodes of constipation that are followed by diarrhoea – a classic pattern is multiple trips to the toilet in the morning to pass stools like ‘rabbit pellets’
bloating

Another possible symptom of diverticular disease is bleeding dark purple blood from your rectum (back passage). This usually occurs after diarrhoea-like cramping pain, and often leads to hospital admission, but fortunately this is an uncommon complication.
Diverticular disease does not cause weight loss, so if you are losing weight, seeing blood in your stools or experiencing frequent bowel changes, see your GP.
Diverticulitis shares most of the symptoms of diverticular disease (see above). However, the pain associated with diverticulitis is constant and severe, rather than intermittent. It is most likely to occur if you have previously had symptoms of diverticular disease, and develops over a day or 2.
Other symptoms of diverticulitis can include:

a high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above
a general feeling of being tired and unwell
feeling sick (nausea) or being sick (vomiting)

The pain usually starts below your belly button, before moving to the lower left-hand side of your abdomen.
In Asian people, the pain may move to the lower right-hand side of your abdomen. This is because East Asian people tend to develop diverticula in a different part of their colon for genetic reasons.
Contact your GP as soon as possible if you think you have symptoms of diverticulitis.
If you have symptoms of diverticular disease and the condition has previously been diagnosed, you do not usually need to contact your GP as the symptoms can be treated at home. 
Read more about the treatment of diverticular disease.
If you have not been diagnosed with the condition, contact your GP so they can rule out other conditions with similar symptoms, such as:

a stomach ulcer
pancreatitis
cholecystitis
bowel cancer

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) can also cause similar symptoms to diverticular disease."
Dizziness (Lightheadedness),
Down’s syndrome,
Dry mouth,
Dysphagia (swallowing problems),
Dystonia,"Symptoms of dystonia can include:

uncontrolled muscle spasms
parts of your body twisting into unusual positions – like your neck being pulled to the side or your feet turning inwards
shaking (tremors)
excessive blinking

The symptoms may be continuous or come and go. They may be triggered by voluntary movements.
There are different types of dystonia.
Generalised dystonia affects all parts of the body.
If you have focal dystonia, only one muscle group is affected.
The most common type of focal dystonia is neck dystonia, also known as cervical dystonia. This usually causes the head to be pulled in one direction. This can then affect movement and cause pain.
Other types of focal dystonia can impact:

your voice (laryngeal dystonia)
the muscles around your eyes (blepharospasm)
limbs (like writer’s cramp)
"
Earache,
Earwax build-up,"A build-up of earwax in your ear can cause:

earache
hearing loss
tinnitus (hearing sounds from inside your body)
itchiness in or around the ear
ear infections

These problems will usually get better once the build up of earwax has been removed.
If the earwax is only causing minor problems, you can try buying some eardrops from a pharmacy. Using drops may make your hearing or symptoms a little worse at first before getting better. These can help soften the earwax so that it falls out naturally.
There are several different types of eardrops you can use, including drops containing:

sodium bicarbonate
olive oil
almond oil

Eardrops aren’t suitable for everyone and some can irritate the skin. You shouldn’t use eardrops if you have a hole or tear in your eardrum.
Speak to your pharmacist about the right product for you and make sure you read the leaflet that comes with it.
Your GP or practice nurse will look inside your ears to check if they’re blocked. They might carry out some simple hearing tests.
If pharmacy treatment doesn’t work, speak to your GP practice.
Treatments may include:

ear irrigation – a quick and painless procedure where an electric pump is used to push water into your ear and wash the earwax out
microsuction – a quick and painless procedure where a small device is used to suck the earwax out of your ear (you may need to be referred for this)

These treatments are not suitable for everyone. Your doctor can discuss this with you.
If these treatments don’t help, your GP may refer you to an ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist.
Some people regularly get blocked ears because they naturally produce a lot of earwax.
Other causes include:

producing naturally hard or dry earwax
having narrow or hairy ear canals (the tube between the opening of the ear and the eardrum)
being elderly, as earwax becomes drier with age
bony growths in the outer part of the ear canal

Earwax can also block your ear if you often insert objects into your ear, such as cotton buds, ear plugs or hearing aids."
Ebola virus disease,"A person infected with Ebola virus will typically develop:

a high temperature (fever)
a headache
joint and muscle pain
a sore throat
severe muscle weakness

These symptoms start suddenly between 2 and 21 days after becoming infected.
Diarrhoea, vomiting, a rash, stomach pain and reduced kidney and liver function can follow. The person may then bleed internally, and may also bleed from the ears, eyes, nose or mouth.
Get medical advice as soon as possible if you become ill while travelling abroad. Phone 111 or contact your GP if you become ill after returning to the UK.
It’s extremely unlikely you have Ebola, but it could be another serious condition such as cholera or malaria, so it’s a good idea to get help in case you need tests or treatment.
Always remember to mention your recent travel history, as this will help identify what the problem could be.
Sometimes your doctor may want to take a sample of your blood, urine or stools so it can be checked for any infections.
The Ebola virus is spread in the blood, body fluids or organs of a person or animal with the infection.
For example, it can be spread by:

directly touching the body of someone with the infection who has symptoms or recently died – the virus can survive for several days outside the body
cleaning up body fluids (blood, stools, urine or vomit) or touching the soiled clothing of an infected person
handling unsterilised needles or medical equipment used in the care of the infected person
having sex with an infected person without using a condom – studies show traces of Ebola may remain in a man’s semen many months after he has recovered
handling or eating raw or undercooked ‘bushmeat’

Ebola can’t be caught through routine social contact, such as shaking hands, with people who don’t have symptoms.
There’s currently no licensed treatment or vaccine for Ebola. Potential new vaccines and drug therapies are being developed and tested.
Any area affected by an outbreak should be immediately quarantined, and people confirmed to have the infection should be treated in isolation in intensive care.
Dehydration is common, so fluids may be given directly into a vein. Blood oxygen levels and blood pressure also need to be maintained at the right level, and body organs supported while the person’s body fights the infection.
Healthcare workers need to avoid contact with the bodily fluids of their infected patients by taking strict precautions, such as wearing protective equipment.
Ebola virus disease is sometimes fatal. The sooner a person is given care, the better the chance they’ll survive.
Follow these simple precautions to minimise your risk of picking up potentially serious infections.
You can check the advice for an area you’re planning to visit using the NHS Fit for Travel destination guide, Travel Health Pro country information or GOV.UK foreign travel advice."
Ectopic pregnancy,"Symptoms usually start when you’re about 6 weeks pregnant and can include:

pain low down and on one side of your abdomen
bleeding from your vagina
pain in the tip of your shoulder
discomfort when going to the toilet
a brown watery discharge from your vagina

You might also have:

other more general symptoms such as pale skin and sweating
missed a period
some of the early signs of being pregnant, such as feeling tired or having sore breasts

It’s important to get medical help quickly if you have any of these symptoms.
Unfortunately, it’s not possible to save an ectopic pregnancy. It will need to be removed:

during an operation
by taking a medicine prescribed by your doctor

Public Health Scotland have created leaflets on pregnancy. 
If you need this leaflet in a different format or language, please contact phs.otherformats@phs.scot."
Edwards’ syndrome,
Endometriosis,"Symptoms can be different from person to person and month to month. Some people have no symptoms at all.
These symptoms may be endometriosis, but could also be other health conditions.
The exact cause of endometriosis is unknown. It’s sometimes believed to be genetic. That means if someone in your family has the condition, it’s more likely you may have it too.
It can be difficult to diagnose endometriosis. Symptoms can vary a lot and many other conditions can cause similar symptoms.
If you think you have symptoms of endometriosis, speak to your doctor. Share as much information as possible during your first appointment. This’ll hopefully help speed up your diagnosis.
It can be helpful to keep a note of your period dates (PDF, 238KB) and symptoms using a calendar, a diary or an app. You can discuss this with your doctor to help them understand what you’re experiencing.
You should let the doctor know if you have:

pain during your period, or at any other times of the month, and where you experience this pain
ever experienced pain or bleeding when you pee or poo, and if this is worse during your period

You should also give the doctor details about the pattern of your periods including:

the first day of your last period (when it started)
how many days your period usually lasts
what was the shortest time between your periods (from the first day of one period to the first day of the next)
what was the longest time between your periods (from the first day of one period to the first day of the next)

You should also let them know:

how you describe your period (light, medium, heavy or very heavy)
if you are over 25, when you had your last smear test
what treatments you have tried before to manage your symptoms

When you see your doctor about your symptoms, they’ll carry out what is called a pelvic examination. They will look at your vulva, vagina and cervix (the opening between the vagina and the womb) using a speculum (medical instrument). The doctor may then do an internal examination in the vagina to feel for tenderness and masses around the ovaries and womb. Sometimes other tests might be needed, such as a pelvic ultrasound scan. Your doctor will discuss this with you and you can ask any questions that you might have.
As this is an intimate examination, the doctor who performs it will have another person (chaperone) present. You can ask for a female doctor to carry it out.
If symptoms continue, your doctor may refer you to a gynaecologist.
The main way to confirm endometriosis is a laparoscopy. A laparoscopy is an operation to insert a camera (a laparoscope) into the pelvis through a small cut near the belly button. This is done under a general anaesthetic.
Sometimes it’s possible to remove some endometriosis tissue at the same time. This will be sent to the laboratory to confirm whether it is endometriosis. After the laparoscopy, the doctor will be able to tell you if you have endometriosis. It’s also possible that no endometriosis is seen at laparoscopy.
Not everyone with endometriosis needs to have a laparoscopy if their symptoms can be managed.
Get further information about laparoscopy in the recovering well patient information leaflet.
There is no cure for endometriosis. Treatments can help to control or improve your symptoms.
A hot water bottle or hot bath may help to provide comfort and help you to feel a bit better.
Paracetamol and non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen and naproxen, can help reduce your pain.
Hormone treatments work by stopping the ovaries (part of the female reproductive system) producing oestrogen (female sex hormone) which is thought to stimulate the endometriosis.
Hormone treatments include:

contraceptive pill (the pill)
progesterone-only pill (mini pill)
contraceptive patch
contraceptive injection
intrauterine system (IUS)
Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues

GnRH analogues also reduce the production of oestrogen. This puts your body in temporary menopausal-like state. They are sometimes used if other hormonal treatments haven’t helped to manage symptoms. It’s recommended that hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is started at the same time to reduce side effects of this treatment.
GnRH analogues aren’t a contraceptive. You should use non-hormonal contraception (like a condom or diaphragm) when you have sex to avoid getting pregnant.
If you’re thinking about planning a pregnancy, speak to your doctor about your treatment first so you can decide what’s best for you.
Some people will have surgery to destroy or remove areas of endometriosis. Not everyone who has endometriosis will need or want surgery.
For some people surgery does not improve their symptoms. For others, the endometriosis may grow back so they may need further surgery. Your doctor will discuss this with you and you can ask any questions that you might have.
Sometimes it’s possible to remove some endometriosis tissue at the same time as diagnosis during a laparoscopy. Your doctor will discuss the findings and any further treatment afterwards.
If you have a complex type of endometriosis that needs specialist treatment, you might be referred to an endometriosis centre. These are in Edinburgh, Glasgow and Aberdeen. You’d usually be referred by a consultant gynaecologist. When you’re seen in the specialist centre, they’ll talk more with you about what options might be right for you.
Not everyone with endometriosis will need laparoscopic surgery. Your doctor will discuss your treatment options so you can decide what’s best for you.
Further information about endometriosis treatment
A hysterectomy (removal of the womb) is not a cure for endometriosis because the condition exists ‘outside the womb’.
For some people, a hysterectomy might relieve some symptoms, like heavy periods or if they also have adenomyosis. It may be an option if hormonal treatments or surgery have not helped symptoms and you don’t want to become pregnant.
You may want to trial a GnRH analogue before having a hysterectomy to help you decide.
If you choose to have a hysterectomy, you’ll need to decide whether to have your ovaries removed at the same time. Removing the ovaries will put you into menopause. Depending on your age and other medical conditions, your doctor may recommend HRT.
Your doctor will discuss your treatment options so you can decide what’s best for you.
Further information about hysterectomy
Endometriosis can also cause:

adhesions – scar tissue that can fuse organs together
ovarian cysts – fluid-filled cysts in the ovaries that can sometimes become very large and painful

Both of these complications can be treated with surgery but may come back if the endometriosis returns.
Read information about treating ovarian cysts
Many people with endometriosis are able to get pregnant naturally. However, some women with endometriosis can find it difficult to get pregnant.
If you’re having difficulty getting pregnant, your doctor may suggest extra support or treatments. Your doctor will discuss these with you and you can ask any questions that you might have.
Sometimes it can be hard to talk about endometriosis and the symptoms you’re experiencing. Hearing about other people’s experiences with endometriosis can help. There might be peer support groups near you or other local groups where you can hear other women’s stories, and share your own."
Epilepsy,"The main symptoms of epilepsy are repeated seizures. There are different types of seizure, depending on which part of the brain it affects.
The cells in the brain, known as neurons, conduct electrical signals. They communicate with each other in the brain using chemical messengers. During a seizure, there are abnormal bursts of neurons firing off electrical impulses. This can cause the brain and body to behave strangely.
The severity of seizures can differ from person to person. Some people experience an odd feeling with no loss of awareness, or may have a “trance-like” state for a few seconds or minutes. Others lose consciousness and have convulsions (uncontrollable shaking of the body).
Some people might only have a single seizure. If they do not have a high risk of having further seizures, they would not be regarded as having epilepsy.
People with epilepsy can experience any type of seizure, although most people have a consistent pattern of symptoms.
Seizures can occur when you’re awake or asleep.
The type of seizure depends on how much of the brain it affects. There are:

focal (or partial) seizures – where only a small part of the brain is affected
generalised seizures – where most or all of the brain is affected

Some seizures do not fit into these categories and are known as unclassified seizures.
There are two main types of focal seizure.
There are 6 main types of generalised seizure.
Myoclonic-tonic-clonic seizures and Myoclonic-atonic are seizures involving a combination of the generalised seizures above.
If you see someone having a seizure, there are some things you can do to help. It will not usually be necessary to call an ambulance after a seizure.
If you’re with someone who has a seizure:

protect them from injury by removing any dangerous or potentially harmful objects nearby
cushion their head with your hands or soft material
do not restrain them or attempt to move them (unless they are in immediate danger)
don’t put anything in their mouth
stay calm, and stay with them until they regain consciousness

When the convulsions have stopped, put them into the recovery position until they’ve recovered.
Status epilepticus is the name for any seizure that lasts longer than 5 minutes, or a series of seizures where the person does not regain consciousness in between. This is a medical emergency and requires treatment as soon as possible.
You can be trained to treat status epilepticus if you care for someone with epilepsy. It’s important to phone 999 for an ambulance immediately if you suspect status epilepticus.
If you’ve been trained to treat the condition, you’ll usually have been advised to use either:

a medication called buccal midazolam that comes in liquid form and is given by trickling the liquid onto the inside of the person’s cheek or up their nose (this is the most common immediate treatment)
a medication called diazepam that’s placed in the person’s rectum (less commonly used)

If you’ve tried one of these treatments and the seizures are continuing, phone 999 for an ambulance."
Erectile dysfunction (impotence),"The main symptom of erectile dysfunction (ED) is the inability to get and maintain an erection for satisfactory intercourse.
ED should not be confused with ejaculation problems such as premature ejaculation, which is a condition where the process of arousal, orgasm and ejaculation occurs very rapidly.
Sometimes ED only occurs in certain situations. For example, you may be able to get an erection during masturbation, or you may find that you sometimes wake up with an erection but you are unable to get an erection with your sexual partner.
In these circumstances, it is likely that the underlying cause of ED is primarily psychological (stress related). However, if you are unable to get an erection under any circumstances, it is likely that the underlying cause is primarily physical.
See your GP if ED persists for more than a few weeks. They will assess your general state of health because the condition can be the first sign of more serious health conditions, such as heart disease (when the heart’s blood supply is blocked or interrupted).
Many websites offer treatments for ED but their use is not recommended. The medications that are offered by these sites could be fake and may be dangerous. Even if the medications are genuine, they may not be suitable for you.
It is important that you only take medication for ED that your GP has prescribed for you.

Escherichia coli (E. coli) O157,"Symptoms include diarrhoea, stomach cramps and occasionally fever. About half of people with the infection will have bloody diarrhoea.
People usually notice symptoms 3 to 4 days after they have been infected. But symptoms can start any time between 1 and 14 days afterwards.
These symptoms can last up to 2 weeks.
A small number of people with E. coli O157 infection go on to develop a serious condition called haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS). Symptoms of HUS include:

peeing less
tiredness
swelling
bruising

This can sometimes lead to kidney failure and death, although this is rare. The risk of HUS is highest in children aged under 5 years.
Some people become infected but don’t develop symptoms.
Further information about gastroenteritis
There is no specific treatment for E. coli O157 infection. People who are infected can usually be cared for at home and most will get better without medical treatment.
It’s important to drink plenty of fluids, as diarrhoea can lead to dehydration.
Antibiotics are not recommended, and may increase the risk of complications.
Anti-diarrhoea drugs such as loperamide (Imodium) are also not recommended as they may prolong your exposure to the toxin.
Find out more about caring for a child with gastroenteritis and caring for an adult with gastroenteritis.
Strict hygiene measures are essential to stop others getting infected.
Anyone who has had an E. coli O157 infection should stay away from work or school until they have been completely free of symptoms for 48 hours.
Most people are no longer infectious after about a week, although some people, particularly children, may carry E. coli O157 for several months after they have got better.
Some people need to take special care before returning to work or school.
If you work in health or social care, or your work involves handling food, you should ask your local authority environmental health officers about when it is safe to return to work. This advice applies to both people who have been infected and those who live in the same household as someone who has.
If you have a child under 5 years of age who has had E. coli, or lives with someone who has, you should talk to your GP about when it is safe for your child to return to school or nursery.
Children under 5 years of age who have had an E. coli O157 infection should not swim in public swimming pools, or share paddling pools with others, until they have had test results showing that they are no longer an infection risk to others."
Ewing sarcoma,"The symptoms of Ewing sarcoma will depend on the size of the cancer and where it is in the body.
The main symptoms are pain in the affected area that gets progressively worse, and swelling and tenderness.
Other possible, but less common, symptoms may include a high temperature (fever), severe tiredness and weight loss.
In some cases of Ewing sarcoma, there may not be any symptoms at all. However, as the tumour grows it could weaken the affected bone, increasing the risk of fracture.
Like other types of bone cancer, the exact cause of Ewing sarcoma is unknown.
As the condition tends to predominantly affect older children and teenagers, one theory is that it may be related to fast-growing bones.
The rapid growth spurt that happens during puberty may in some way make bone tissue more vulnerable to cancer.
Research has also found babies born with an umbilical hernia are 3 times more likely to develop Ewing sarcoma. 
However, the increased risk is still small as only 1 in 110,000 children with an umbilical hernia will go on to develop the condition.
The Cancer Research UK website has more information about the risks and causes of bone cancer.
When you visit your GP because of bone pain, they’ll ask you about your symptoms and examine the affected area.
Your GP may refer you for an X-ray to check for anything abnormal. If abnormalities are found, you’ll be referred to an orthopaedic surgeon (a bone specialist).
They may recommend that you have a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan to examine the area in closer detail.
A bone biopsy may be carried out to confirm whether cancer is present. A fine needle is used to remove a sample of bone marrow from the affected area so it can be examined under a microscope. It can either be carried out using a general anaesthetic or a local anaesthetic.
The Cancer Research UK website has more information about tests for bone cancer and the stages of bone cancer.
Like all types of cancer, the earlier Ewing sarcoma is diagnosed, the easier it is to treat.
Ewing sarcoma is usually treated with a combination of chemotherapy, surgery and radiotherapy.
Chemotherapy may be used before surgery to shrink the tumour and make it easier to remove.
Ewing sarcoma also responds well to radiotherapy. It can be used to shrink the tumour after chemotherapy, and before or after surgery to lower the risk of the cancer returning.
In some cases, surgically removing Ewing’s sarcoma can be difficult – for example, if it develops in the pelvis. In this case, radiotherapy may be used as the main treatment.
If surgery is recommended, the type you’ll have will depend on:

the size of the tumour
where it is in your body
whether it has grown into the tissues surrounding the bone

You may have surgery to remove part or all of the bone affected by cancer. This type of surgery is known as resection.
Limb-sparing surgery involves removing the area of bone on an arm or leg where the cancer is growing. A piece of metal (prosthesis) or a bone graft will be used to replace the piece of bone that is removed.
In some cases, your whole arm or leg may need to be removed (amputation). This may be the only option to prevent the cancer returning if it’s spread into the tissues surrounding the bone.
For more information about the types of treatment for bone cancer, visit the Cancer Research UK website.
If you’re diagnosed with bone cancer, it can be upsetting and frightening. Knowing as much about the type of cancer you have and the best treatment options will help you make decisions.
The majority of people who have surgery for bone cancer have a limb-sparing procedure.
However, for some people, having their limb amputated may be the best option. This can be a very difficult situation to cope with and you may experience emotions such as grief and bereavement.
It’s important to seek help and talk about how you’re feeling. You could talk to your partner, family, friends or the healthcare professionals in charge of your care. Talking to others will help you come to terms with your condition and treatment.
There are also a number of practical issues you’ll need to deal with, such as financial matters and coping with day-to-day activities such as school, college or work.
The Cancer Research UK website has more information on coping with bone cancer.
If you or your child has Ewing sarcoma, your clinical team will pass information about you/your child on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS).
This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time.

Ewing sarcoma: Children,
Eye cancer,"Eye cancer doesn’t always cause obvious symptoms and may only be picked up during a routine eye test.
Symptoms of eye cancer can include:

shadows, flashes of light, or wiggly lines in your vision
blurred vision
a dark patch in your eye that’s getting bigger
partial or total loss of vision
bulging of one eye
a lump on your eyelid or in your eye that’s increasing in size
pain in or around your eye, although this is rare

These symptoms can also be caused by more minor eye conditions, so they’re not necessarily a sign of cancer. However, it’s important to get the symptoms checked by a doctor as soon as possible.
Melanoma is cancer that develops from pigment-producing cells called melanocytes. Most melanomas develop in the skin, but it’s also possible for them to occur in other parts of the body, including the eye.
Eye melanoma most commonly affects the eyeball. Doctors sometimes call it uveal or choroidal melanoma, depending on exactly which part of your eye is affected.
It can also affect the conjunctiva, the thin layer that covers the front of the eye, or the eyelid.
Eye melanoma occurs when the pigment-producing cells in the eyes divide and multiply too rapidly. This produces a lump of tissue known as a tumour.
It’s not clear exactly why this occurs, but the following factors may increase the risk of it happening:

lighter eye colour – if you have blue, grey or green eyes, you have a higher risk of developing eye melanoma compared with people who have brown eyes
white or pale skin – eye melanoma mostly affects white people and is more common in those with fair skin
unusual moles – if you have irregularly shaped or unusually coloured moles, you’re more at risk of developing skin cancer and eye melanoma
use of sunbeds – there’s some evidence to suggest that exposing yourself to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from sunbeds, for example, can increase your risk of eye melanoma
overexposure to sunlight – this increases your risk of skin cancer, and may also be a risk factor for eye melanoma

The risk of developing eye melanoma also increases with age, with most cases being diagnosed in people in their fifties.
If your GP or optician (optometrist) suspects you have a serious problem with your eyes, they will refer you to a specialist eye doctor called an ophthalmologist for an assessment.
If they suspect you have melanoma of the eye, they’ll refer you to a specialist centre for eye cancer. There are 4 centres in the UK, located in London, Sheffield, Liverpool, and Glasgow.
It’s likely you’ll have a number of different tests at the centre, including:

an eye examination – to look at the structures of your eyes in more detail and check for abnormalities
an ultrasound scan of your eye – a small probe placed over your closed eye uses high-frequency sound waves to create an image of the inside of your eye; this allows your doctor to find out more about the position of the tumour and its size
a fluorescein angiogram – where photographs of the suspected cancer are taken using a special camera after dye has been injected into your bloodstream to highlight the tumour

Occasionally, a thin needle may be used to remove a small sample of cells from the tumour (biopsy). The genetic information in these cells is analysed to give an indication of the chances of the cancer spreading or coming back.
Treatment for melanoma of the eye depends on the size and location of the tumour. Your care team will explain each treatment option in detail, including the benefits and any potential complications.
Treatment will aim to conserve the affected eye whenever possible.
The main treatments for eye melanoma are:

brachytherapy – tiny plates lined with radioactive material called plaques are inserted near the tumour and left in place for up to a week to kill the cancerous cells
external radiotherapy – a machine is used to carefully aim beams of radiation at the tumour to kill the cancerous cells
surgery to remove the tumour or part of the eye – this may be possible if the tumour is small and you still have some vision in your eye
removal of the eye (enucleation) – this may be necessary if the tumour is large or you’ve lost your vision; the eye will eventually be replaced with an artificial eye that matches your other eye

Chemotherapy is rarely used for eye melanoma, but may be suitable for other types of eye cancer.
The Cancer Research UK website has more information about the treatment options for eye cancer and the types of eye cancer surgery."
Farting,
Febrile seizures,"The main symptom of a febrile seizure is a fit that occurs while a child has a fever.
Febrile seizures often occur during the first day of a fever, which is defined as a high temperature of 38C (100.4F) or above. 
However, there appears to be no connection between the extent of your child’s fever and the start of a seizure. Seizures can occur even if your child has a mild fever.
Simple febrile seizures can happen when there’s a rapid rise in temperature and you may only realise your child is ill when they have a fit. Alternatively, they can occur as your child’s temperature drops from a high level.
During simple febrile seizures:

your child’s body will become stiff and their arms and legs will begin to twitch
they’ll lose consciousness and they may wet or soil themselves
they may also vomit and foam at the mouth and their eyes may roll back
the seizure usually lasts for less than five minutes
following the seizure, your child may be sleepy for up to an hour afterwards

Complex febrile seizures tend to last longer than 15 minutes, and the symptoms may only affect one area of your child’s body. The seizure sometimes recurs within 24 hours or during the period in which your child is ill.
You should take your child to hospital or dial 999 for an ambulance if:

your child is having a fit for the first time
the seizure lasts longer than five minutes and shows no signs of stopping
you suspect the seizure is being caused by another serious illness, for example meningitis
your child is having breathing difficulties

If your child has previously had febrile seizures, it’s recommended that you telephone your GP or call the NHS 24 111 service for advice.
You should also contact your GP or the NHS 24 111 service if your child shows signs and symptoms of dehydration (a lack of fluid in the body). This includes:

a dry mouth
sunken eyes
a lack of tears when crying
a sunken fontanelle – the soft spot usually found at the top of a young child’s head
"
Feeling of something in your throat (Globus),"Different people describe globus differently. It may be felt as:

tightness or a pressure in your throat
mucus that you cannot clear (catarrh)
an area of discomfort in your throat
a feeling of something stuck or a lump in your throat

If you feel something sticking in your throat, but can eat and drink normally and without pain, you do not need to worry.
Your symptoms may:

be most noticeable you’re swallowing your saliva
get worse with stress and worry
vary from day to day

If your symptoms do not improve, your GP will provide further support and advice on whether you need to see an ear nose and throat (ENT) specialist.
There are a number of things you can do to try to relieve globus symptoms.
In most people, symptoms will get better following these self-help tips. However, for some people symptoms can recur off and on for several months.
Smoking causes irritation to your throat. By stopping smoking, you can help to improve your globus symptoms.
Further information on stopping smoking
Try not to clear your throat as this can make your globus sensation worse. Try sipping water instead.
Losing any excess weight may reduce your symptoms.
Stress can increase your globus sensation.
If you think you might be stressed, try to relax in a way that is doable for you and your situation. Breathing and relaxation exercises can sometimes help. If you feel you need further help with managing stress, your GP can discuss this with you.

Fibroids,"Many people don’t know that they have fibroids because they don’t have any symptoms. This is nothing to worry about.
If your doctor thinks you might have fibroids, they’ll usually refer you for an ultrasound scan to confirm the diagnosis.
The exact cause of fibroids is unknown. They’re linked to the hormones produced by the ovaries, oestrogen and progesterone. Fibroids usually develop and grow as long as the ovaries are producing these hormones. Fibroids may continue to grow during pregnancy. They tend to shrink when these hormone levels fall, such as after the menopause.
There are different types of fibroid. The main types of fibroids are:

intramural – the most common type of fibroid, these develop in the muscular wall of the womb
subserosal – fibroids that develop on the outside part of the wall of the womb and can become very large
submucosal – fibroids that develop in the muscular layer of the womb beneath the womb’s inner lining (endometrium) and grow into the inside of the womb
pedunculated – subserosal or submucosal fibroids that are attached to the womb with a narrow stalk of tissue

Fibroids will often shrink after the menopause, as hormone levels in your body change.
If you have fibroids, but you’re not affected by any symptoms then you don’t need treatment.
However, if you do have symptoms, your doctor can recommend the right treatment for you. Treatment options include:

over-the-counter pain relief like ibuprofen
the contraceptive pill which can reduce heavy menstrual bleeding
medication taken only during your period that can reduce heavy menstrual bleeding
medicines that can shrink fibroids by lowering your oestrogen and progesterone levels
in rare cases, surgery

Your doctor will discuss these treatments with you and you can ask any questions that you might have.
If you’re having difficulty getting pregnant, your doctor or specialist may suggest extra support or treatments that can help. Your doctor will discuss these with you and you can ask any questions that you might have."
Fibromyalgia,"The main symptom of fibromyalgia is widespread pain that might feel like:

an ache
a burning sensation
a sharp stabbing pain
a mixture of these 3 feelings

The pain is likely to be continuous, but it might be better or more severe at different times.
As well as widespread pain, people with fibromyalgia might also have:

increased sensitivity to sensations like touch, light, temperature, noise
fatigue (extreme tiredness)
muscle stiffness
difficulty sleeping
problems with mental processes (known as “fibro-fog”) – like problems with memory and concentration
headaches
irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) – a digestive condition that causes stomach pain and bloating
dizziness and clumsiness
feeling too hot or too cold
restless legs syndrome
tingling, numbness, prickling or burning sensations in your hands and feet (pins and needles, also known as paraesthesia)
unusually painful periods (if you get periods)
anxiety
depression

Foetal alcohol syndrome,
Food allergy,"The symptoms of a food allergy almost always develop a few seconds or minutes after eating the food.
Some people may develop a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis), which can be life threatening.
The most common type of allergic reaction to food is known as an IgE-mediated food allergy.
Symptoms include:

tingling or itching in the mouth
a raised, itchy red rash (urticarial) – in some cases, the skin can turn red and itchy, but without a raised rash
swelling of the face, mouth (angioedema), throat or other areas of the body
difficulty swallowing
wheezing or shortness of breath
feeling dizzy and lightheaded
feeling sick (nausea) or vomiting
abdominal pain or diarrhoea
hay fever-like symptoms, such as sneezing or itchy eyes (allergic conjunctivitus) 

The symptoms of a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) can be sudden and get worse very quickly.
Initial symptoms of anaphylaxis are often the same as those listed above and can lead to:

increased breathing difficulties – such as wheezing and a cough
a sudden and intense feeling of anxiety and fear
a rapid heartbeat (tachycardia)
a sharp and sudden drop in your blood pressure, which can make you feel lightheaded and confused
unconsciousness

Anaphylaxis is a medical emergency. Without quick treatment, it can be life threatening. If you think you or someone you know is experiencing anaphylaxis, dial 999 and ask for an ambulance as soon as possible.
Another type of allergic reaction is a non-IgE-mediated food allergy. The symptoms of this type of allergy can take much longer to develop – sometimes up to several days.
Some symptoms of a non IgE-mediated food allergy may be what you would expect to see in an allergic reaction, such as:

redness and itchiness of the skin – although not a raised, itchy red rash (urticarial)
the skin becomes itchy, red, dry and cracked (atopic eczema)

Other symptoms can be much less obvious and are sometimes thought of as being caused by something other than an allergy. They include:

heartburn and indigestion caused by stomach acid leaking up out of the stomach (gastro-oesophageal reflux disease)
stools (faeces) becoming much more frequent or loose – though not necessarily diarrhoea
blood and mucus in the stools
in babies – excessive and inconsolable crying, even though the baby is well fed and doesn’t need a nappy change (colic)
constipation 
redness around the anus, rectum and genitals
unusually pale skin
failure to grow at the expected rate

Some children can have a mixed reaction where they experience both IgE symptoms, such as swelling, and non-IgE symptoms, such as constipation.
This can happen to children who have a milk allergy."
Food poisoning,"Symptoms of food poisoning include:

feeling sick (nausea)
being sick (vomiting)
diarrhoea, which may contain blood or mucus
stomach cramps and abdominal pain
a lack of energy and weakness
loss of appetite
a high temperature of 38C or above (fever)
aching muscles
chills

The symptoms of food poisoning usually begin within 1 to 2 days of eating contaminated food. They can also start a few hours later or several weeks later.
Food poisoning is caused by eating something that’s been contaminated with germs. Any type of food can cause food poisoning.
Food can be contaminated if it’s

not cooked or reheated thoroughly
not stored correctly – for example, it’s not been frozen or chilled
left out for too long
handled by someone who’s ill or hasn’t washed their hands
eaten after its ‘use by’ date
not reheating cooked food well enough

Frozen shoulder,"Pain and persistent stiffness in the shoulder joint are the two main symptoms of a frozen shoulder.
This makes it painful and difficult to carry out the full range of normal shoulder movements. You may find it difficult to perform everyday tasks, such as:

bathing
dressing
driving
sleeping comfortably

Symptoms vary from mild, with little difference to daily activities, to severe, where it may not be possible to move your shoulder at all.
The symptoms of a frozen shoulder usually get worse gradually, over a number of months.
There are three separate stages to the condition but sometimes these stages may be difficult to distinguish. The symptoms may also vary greatly from person to person.
During stage one, often referred to as the “freezing” phase, your shoulder starts to ache and can become very painful, for example, when reaching out for things.
The pain is often worse at night and when you lie on the affected side. This stage can last anywhere from 2-9 months.
Stage two is often known as the “frozen” phase. Your shoulder may become increasingly stiff, but the pain doesn’t usually get worse and may even decrease.
The stiffness in your shoulder can continue to affect your day to day activities. This stage usually lasts 4-12 months.
Stage three is known as the “thawing” phase. During this period, you’ll gradually regain movement in your shoulder.
If pain is still present it should start to fade, although it may come back occasionally as the stiffness eases. This stage can last 12 months or more.
In order for a frozen shoulder to be diagnosed you’ll need an assessment from a healthcare professional.
They’ll initially ask you questions about your shoulder issue and then carry out a physical examination. This will include checking your range of movement and strength.
You may sometimes need to have a further examination to rule out other possible health conditions.
Treatment options depend on the severity of your symptoms. Although, most cases improve on their own, some cases can take over a year to resolve.
During the painful phase the emphasis is on pain relief. Pain medication can help you move more comfortably, which can help your recovery.
More about taking painkillers.
It may also help to use heat or ice packs.
Exercise 
Targeted shoulder exercises to encourage movement, stretching and strengthening exercises can help to improve your arm movement and pain. 
The British Elbow and Shoulder Society have a video with specific exercises to help with a frozen shoulder.
Stop these exercises if they make your symptoms worse, or if they cause new pain.
If your shoulder pain worsens while following this advice, it’s a good idea to talk to a healthcare professional about your symptoms.
Corticosteroid Injections
If painkillers aren’t helping to control the pain, your healthcare professional may discuss the option of having a corticosteroid injection into your shoulder joint.
Corticosteroids are medicines that help reduce pain and inflammation. They may also be given with a local anaesthetic.
Injections won’t cure your condition or reduce shoulder stiffness, they are used to help with the pain.
Read more about corticosteroids
A frozen shoulder can sometimes mean you need to take some time off work to help recovery. How long you’re off will depend on the nature of your condition and your role at work.
You do not need to be symptom free before you consider returning to work. Continuing to go to work, or returning to work as soon as is possible for you, will help your recovery. Gradually getting back to your normal daily activities can help to build up your strength and stamina levels.
Following this advice, you should see gradual improvements over time.
If your frozen shoulder hasn’t improved, or it’s got worse, within 6 weeks of following this advice, it’s a good idea to contact a healthcare professional about your symptoms.

When dealing with any health condition it’s important to also look after your mental wellbeing as this can impact your recovery."
Functional neurological disorder (FND),"FND can have many symptoms that can vary from person to person. Some people may have few symptoms, and some people may have many.
There are other symptoms or conditions that are commonly associated with FND. These include:

chronic pain, including fibromyalgia, back and neck pain, and complex regional pain syndrome
persistent fatigue
sleep problems including insomnia (not sleeping enough) and hypersomnia (sleeping too much)
migraines and other types of headache and facial pain
irritable bowel syndrome and other problems with the function of your stomach and bowel
anxiety and panic attacks
depression
post-traumatic stress disorder
chronic urinary retention despite all tests being normal (which may be diagnosed as Fowlers syndrome)
dysfunctional breathing

We know that the symptoms of FND happen because there’s a problem with how the brain is sending and receiving messages to itself and other parts of the body. Using research tools, scientists can see that certain circuits in the brain are not working properly in people with FND.
However, there’s still a lot of research to be done to understand how and why FND happens.
FND can happen for a wide range of reasons. There’s often more than one reason, and the reasons can vary hugely from person to person.
Some of the reasons why the brain stops working properly in FND include:

the brain trying to get rid of a painful sensation
a migraine or other neurological symptom
the brain shutting down a part or all of the body in response to a situation it thinks is threatening

In some people, stressful events in the past or present can be relevant to FND. In others, stress is not relevant.
The risk of developing FND increases if you have another neurological condition.
Read more about how and why FND happens.
When diagnosing FND, your healthcare provider will carry out an assessment to see if there are typical clinical features of FND.
Your healthcare provider may still choose to test for other diseases and conditions before diagnosing FND. This is because many conditions share the same symptoms and, in around a quarter of cases, FND is present alongside another neurological condition. Someone can have both FND and conditions like sciatica, carpal tunnel syndrome, epilepsy, or multiple sclerosis (MS).
The diagnosis of FND, however, should be given because you have the clinical features of FND. It shouldn’t be given just because there’s no evidence of other conditions or illnesses.
Because the symptoms of FND are not always there, your healthcare provider may ask you to video your symptoms. This will allow them to see what your symptoms look like.
FND is a really variable condition. Some people have quite short-lived symptoms. Others can have them for many years.
There are treatments available that can manage and improve FND. These treatments are all forms of rehabilitation therapy, which aims to improve your ability to carry out every day activities. Many of these treatments are designed to ‘retrain the brain’. Some people with FND benefit a lot from treatment and may go into remission. Other people continue to have FND symptoms despite treatment.
Read more about treating FND
FND is broadly the same condition in children and young people. It’s unusual for it to occur under the age of 10. It becomes more common through the teenage years.
The treatment for FND in children and young people is similar to adults. It’s especially important for families and schools to learn about the condition, so they can respond in the most helpful way.
If you’ve been diagnosed with FND there are sources of information, charities and support groups that can help you.
The Neurosymptoms FND Guide has more detailed information. There’s also an app available with further details about the condition.
My FND is an app that allows you to learn about your symptoms. It helps you track them, and offers advice for managing them.
FND Hope UK is a charity that raises awareness of FND. It provides further information, resources, and support services for those with FND.
FND Action is a charity that provides information on FND and support for those with a diagnosis."
Fungal nail infection,
Gallbladder cancer,"In the early stages, gallbladder cancer doesn’t cause symptoms, which means it could be at an advanced stage by the time it’s diagnosed.
Symptoms that occur at a later stage can include:

abdominal (stomach) pain
feeling sick
jaundice (yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes)

These symptoms could be linked to a number of conditions and may not be related to gallbladder cancer. However, if you have these symptoms, you should speak to your GP so they can investigate what’s causing them.
Other possible symptoms of gallbladder cancer can include loss of appetite, unexplained weight loss and a swollen stomach.
In gallbladder cancer, abnormal cells grow within the gallbladder. It’s not known why this happens, but certain things are thought to increase your chances of developing the condition.
Gallbladder cancer is more common in older people, and your chances of developing it increase with age.
Lifestyle factors – such as obesity, smoking and an unhealthy diet – are believed to increase the risk of gallbladder cancer. However, there’s not enough evidence to show a firm link between diet and gallbladder cancer.
There are also a number of conditions that can increase your chances of developing gallbladder cancer. For example, gallstones, cholecystitis (inflammation of the gallbladder) and diabetes have been closely linked to the condition.
If you have a family history of gallstones, cholecystitis, or gallbladder cancer, you’re more likely to develop these conditions yourself.
The Cancer Research UK website has more information about the risks and causes of gallbladder cancer.
Your GP will examine you and ask about your symptoms. If they suspect gallbladder cancer, they may refer you to a specialist, usually a gastroenterologist (a doctor who specialises in conditions of the digestive system).
The specialist will ask about your medical history and check to see whether the lymph glands in your neck and groin are swollen.
You may also have some initial tests, including:

blood tests
an ultrasound scan
a computerised tomography (CT) scan

If these tests reveal anything abnormal in or around your gallbladder, further tests may be arranged to help confirm whether you have gallbladder cancer. These may include:

an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)
a magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP)
biopsy and fine needle aspiration (FNA)

The Cancer Research UK website has more information about tests for gallbladder cancer.
The main treatment for gallbladder cancer is surgery to remove the gallbladder and possibly some of the surrounding tissue.
Chemotherapy and radiotherapy are also sometimes used, either on their own or in combination with surgery.
The treatment programme that’s most suitable for you will depend on:

the type of gallbladder cancer you have
the stage of your cancer
your overall level of health

As with all cancers, the chances of survival depend on how far the condition has advanced when it is diagnosed.
The Cancer Research UK website has more information about treating gallbladder cancer and the stages and outlook for gallbladder cancer. "
Gallstones,"Most cases of gallstones don’t cause any symptoms. But if a gallstone blocks one of the bile ducts, it can cause sudden, severe abdominal pain, known as biliary colic.
Other symptoms may develop if the blockage is more severe or develops in another part of the digestive system.
Gallstones can cause sudden, severe abdominal pain that usually lasts 1 to 5 hours (although it can sometimes last just a few minutes).
The pain can be felt:

in the centre of your abdomen (tummy)
just under the ribs on your right-hand side – it may spread from here to your side or shoulder blade

The pain is constant and isn’t relieved when you go to the toilet, pass wind or are sick. It’s sometimes triggered by eating fatty foods, but may occur at any time of day and it may wake you up during the night.
Biliary colic doesn’t happen often. After an episode of pain, it may be several weeks or months before you experience another episode.
Some people also have periods where they sweat excessively and feel sick or vomit.
When gallstones cause episodes of biliary colic, it is known as ‘uncomplicated gallstone disease’.
In a small number of people, gallstones can cause more serious problems if they obstruct the flow of bile for longer periods or move into other organs (such as the pancreas or small bowel).
If this happens, you may develop:

a high temperature of 38C (100.4F) or above
more persistent pain
a rapid heartbeat
yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice)
itchy skin
diarrhoea
chills or shivering attacks
confusion
a loss of appetite

Doctors refer to this more severe condition as ‘complicated gallstone disease’.
Read more about the complications of gallstones.
If you think you may be experiencing biliary colic, you should make an appointment with your GP.
Contact your GP immediately for advice if you develop:

jaundice
abdominal pain lasting longer than eight hours
a high temperature and chills
abdominal pain so intense that you can’t find a position to relieve it

If it’s not possible to contact your GP immediately, phone your local out-of-hours or NHS 24’s 111 service."
Ganglion cyst,
Gastroenteritis,"The main symptoms of gastroenteritis are:

sudden, watery diarrhoea
feeling sick
vomiting, which can be projectile
a mild fever

Some people also have other symptoms, such as a loss of appetite, an upset stomach, aching limbs and headaches.
The symptoms usually appear up to a day after becoming infected. They typically last less than a week, but can sometimes last longer.
If you experience sudden diarrhoea and vomiting, the best thing to do is stay at home until you’re feeling better. There’s not always a specific treatment, so you have to let the illness run its course.
You don’t usually need to get medical advice, unless your symptoms don’t improve or there’s a risk of a more serious problem.
There are things you can do to help ease your symptoms.
Read further information about treating dehydration
Gastroenteritis can spread very easily. You should wash your hands regularly while you’re ill and stay off work or school until at least 48 hours after your symptoms have cleared, to reduce the risk of passing it on.
You don’t normally need to see your GP if you think you have gastroenteritis, as it should get better on its own.
Visiting your GP practice can put others at risk, so it’s best to phone 111 or your GP if you’re concerned or feel you need advice.
Your GP may suggest sending off a sample of your poo to a laboratory to check what’s causing your symptoms. Antibiotics may be prescribed if this shows you have a bacterial infection.
You can look after your child at home if they have diarrhoea and vomiting. There’s not usually any specific treatment and your child should start feeling better in a few days.
You don’t normally need to get medical advice unless their symptoms don’t improve or there’s a risk of a more serious problem.
There are things you can do to help ease your child’s symptoms.
Don’t give your child antidiarrhoeal and anti-vomiting medication, unless advised to by your GP or pharmacist.
Make sure you and your child wash your hands regularly while your child is ill. Keep them away from school or nursery until at least 48 hours after their symptoms have cleared.
You don’t usually need to see your GP if you think your child has gastroenteritis, as it should get better on its own, and taking them to a GP practice can put others at risk. 
Your GP may suggest sending off a sample of your child’s poo to a laboratory to confirm what’s causing their symptoms. Antibiotics may be prescribed if this shows they have a bacterial infection.
The bugs that cause gastroenteritis can spread very easily from person to person.
You can catch the infection if small particles of vomit or poo from an infected person get into your mouth, such as through:

close contact with someone with gastroenteritis – they may breathe out small particles of vomit
touching contaminated surfaces or objects
eating contaminated food – this can happen if an infected person doesn’t wash their hands before handling food, or you eat food that has been in contact with contaminated surfaces or objects, or hasn’t been stored and cooked at the correct temperatures

A person with gastroenteritis is most infectious from when their symptoms start until 48 hours after all their symptoms have passed, although they may also be infectious for a short time before and after this.
It’s not always possible to avoid getting gastroenteritis, but following this advice can help stop it spreading.
Take extra care when travelling to parts of the world with poor sanitation, as you could pick up a stomach bug. For example, you may need to boil tap water before drinking it.
Young children can have the rotavirus vaccination when they’re 2 to 3 months old, which can reduce their risk of developing gastroenteritis."
Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD),"The main symptoms of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) are heartburn and acid reflux.
Heartburn is an uncomfortable burning sensation in the chest.
It’s usually felt just below your breastbone, but can spread up to the throat in some people.
The discomfort is usually worse after eating, or when bending over or lying down.
Acid reflux is where acid and other stomach contents are brought back up (regurgitated) into your throat and mouth.
It usually causes an unpleasant, sour taste at the back of your mouth.
If you have GORD, you may also experience:

a sore, inflamed oesophagus (oesophagitis)
bad breath
bloating and belching
feeling or being sick
difficulty swallowing, which may feel like a piece of food is stuck low down in your throat
pain when swallowing 
a sore throat and hoarseness
a persistent cough or wheezing, which may be worse at night
tooth decay and gum disease

If you also have asthma, the symptoms may get worse as a result of stomach acid irritating your airways."
Genital herpes,"Most people with the herpes virus don’t notice any symptoms and don’t know they have it. So it’s important to get tested if you think you’re infected.
If you do get symptoms, it takes usually 2 to 12 days after contact for them to appear. Some people don’t get symptoms until months or sometimes years later.
Once you have the herpes infection, the virus stays in your body. It can lie dormant for long periods but can reactivate in the area that was originally infected. If this happens, the sores and blisters can reappear. This is known as a ‘recurrent episode’ of genital herpes.
This first episode of genital herpes may last from 2 to 4 weeks.
Repeated episodes are not usually as severe, or long, as the first and you may never have a repeat episode.
Symptoms of the first infection include:

spots or red bumps around the genital area
pain inside the vagina, head of penis or anus
vaginal discharge
pain peeing or being unable to pee
fever
flu-like symptoms, backache, headache and a temperature
mild swelling of the lymph glands in the groin, armpits and neck

If you have a recurrent infection, your symptoms may include:

a tingling or burning sensation before blisters appear
painful red blisters, which soon burst to leave ulcers
pain inside the vagina, head of penis or anus

If you think you might have genital herpes, get tested for free by:

contacting your GP practice for an appointment
booking an appointment at your local sexual health service

Your doctor or nurse may be able to diagnose by looking at symptoms such as blisters, sores and ulcers.
If you have visible blisters, your doctor or nurse may take a swab for testing. This is to check if it’s herpes and what type. The swab can also test for another STI which causes blisters called syphilis.
The genital herpes swab tests are very reliable, though if the ulcer is too dry then it may be less likely to find a positive result.
Genital herpes can be treated with antiviral medication.
The symptoms of genital herpes can be treated, although it could keep coming back.
Symptoms of recurrent genital herpes will usually clear up without any treatment.
Some people experience recurrences of genital herpes. In these cases, a longer course of tablets should stop any recurrent episodes.
You can talk to your GP or nurse about which treatment options are right for you.
As there’s no screening test for herpes, partners should only have a test if they also have symptoms.
You can get genital herpes:

from skin to skin contact with the infected area (including vaginal, anal and oral sex)
when there are no visible sores or blisters
if a cold sore touches your genitals or face
kissing (if the person has a cold sore on their face)
by sharing sex toys with someone who has herpes

Sometimes herpes can be passed on when your sexual partner has no visible sores or symptoms. This is because the virus can become active on the skin without causing any visible blisters or sores. This is sometimes called ‘asymptomatic shedding’.
This risk goes down during the first months after you catch herpes and is not likely after two years. However, it is more common when people are still having frequent recurrences.
Very rarely, herpes is passed to a newborn baby during childbirth. This is only likely to happen if a mother has her first episode of herpes after week 26 of the pregnancy. When women have had herpes longer than three months, normal delivery is expected even if there are symptoms at the time of delivery.
The best way to reduce your risk of STIs is to practice safer sex. This means using a condom for vaginal, anal and oral sex.
If your partner has herpes, avoiding sex when they have visible sores reduces your risk of getting herpes.
If you’ve been diagnosed with herpes it’s recommended that you are tested for all STIs including:

chlamydia
gonorrhoea
syphilis
HIV

This is even more important if you have recurrent episodes."
Genital symptoms,
Genital warts,"It can take a few weeks or months for genital warts to appear after becoming infected.
Genital warts are usually small, rough lumps on the skin.
They can appear:

around the vagina and on the penis
around the anus
on the skin between the genitals and the anus

Genital warts may:

appear on their own or in a group (groups of warts can look like a cauliflower)
feel soft or firm
be white, red, skin-coloured, or darker than the surrounding skin

They don’t usually cause symptoms but can sometimes be painful, itchy or bleed.
The test for genital warts involves an examination of the genital area.
If you think you might have genital warts, get checked for free by:

contacting your GP practice for an appointment
booking an appointment at your local sexual health service

Warts must be diagnosed by a doctor or nurse.
Treatment for genital warts is not always needed. They sometimes disappear on their own within 6 months.
If treatment is recommended, it’ll be prescribed by your doctor.
Your doctor or nurse may advise you to avoid sex while you’re having treatment for genital warts.
The type of treatment you’ll be offered depends on what your warts are like. Your doctor or nurse will discuss this with you.
Treatment options include:

cream or liquid
freezing
surgery

You can usually apply this to the warts yourself a few times a week for several weeks.
A doctor or nurse freezes the warts with liquid nitrogen, usually every week for 4 weeks.
A doctor or nurse can cut or burn the warts off. This is usually only recommended if the warts are not responding or are too large for cream or freezing. Side effects of these treatments include:

bleeding
wound infection
scarring

Genital warts are not usually harmful during pregnancy.
During pregnancy, genital warts may:

multiply and get bigger (they may be removed if they’re very big)
become more easily irritated
be passed on to the baby during childbirth, but this is very rare (the HPV virus can cause infection in the baby’s throat or genitals)

Most creams, liquids and ointments used to treat genital warts are not recommended during pregnancy. Freezing can be used but it’s often not very successful.
Genital warts usually disappear on their own within 6 weeks after childbirth.
You can get genital warts from skin to skin contact.
Other ways of getting genital warts include:

unprotected vaginal, anal, or oral sex (sex without a condom)
sharing sex toys with an infected person

The best way to reduce your risk of STIs is to practice safer sex. This means using a condom for vaginal, anal, and oral sex, and when sharing sex toys.
You can get warts even if you use condoms, as a condom does not cover the whole genital area.
The HPV vaccination will reduce your risk of getting HPV virus which causes warts. However, it doesn’t treat warts once you have them.
Genital warts are not cancer and don’t cause cancer. They’re caused by a different strain of HPV.
HPV vaccination is offered to every person aged 11 to 13. The vaccine can protect against cervical cancer also protects against genital warts.
The HPV vaccine is also offered to men who have sex with men (MSM) and trans people aged up to 45 years.
If you didn’t have the vaccine at school and don’t fulfill the above criteria, you can pay for the vaccine privately.
If you’ve been diagnosed with genital warts it’s recommended that you’re tested for all STIs including:

chlamydia
gonorrhoea
syphilis
HIV

Germ cell tumours,
Glandular fever,"Symptoms of glandular fever are thought to take around 1 to 2 months to develop after infection with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV).
The most common symptoms of the condition are:

a high temperature (fever)
a sore throat – this is usually more painful than any you may have had before
swollen glands in your neck and possibly in other parts of your body, such as under your armpits
fatigue (extreme tiredness)

Glandular fever can also cause:

a general sense of feeling unwell
aching muscles
chills
sweats
loss of appetite
pain around or behind your eyes
swollen tonsils and adenoids (small lumps of tissue at the back of the nose), which may affect your breathing
the inside of your throat to become very red and ooze fluid
small red or purple spots on the roof of your mouth
a rash
swelling or ‘puffiness’ around your eyes
a tender or swollen tummy
jaundice (yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes)

Some of these symptoms may develop a few days before the main symptoms mentioned above.
Most symptoms of glandular fever will usually resolve within 2 or 3 weeks. Your throat will normally feel most sore for 3 to 5 days after symptoms start before gradually improving, and your fever will usually last 10 to 14 days.
Fatigue is the most persistent symptom and often lasts a few weeks, although some people may feel persistently fatigued for several months after the other symptoms have passed.
You should contact your GP if you suspect that you or your child has glandular fever.
While there is little your GP can do in terms of treatment other than provide advice and support, blood tests may be needed to rule out less common but more serious causes of your symptoms, such as hepatitis (a viral infection that affects the liver).
You should go to your local accident and emergency (A&E) department or phone 999 for an ambulance if you have glandular fever and you:

develop a rasping breath (stridor) or have any breathing difficulties
find swallowing fluids difficult
develop intense abdominal pain

If you have these symptoms, you may need to be looked after in hospital for a few days.

Golfers elbow,"Golfer’s elbow causes pain and tenderness on the inside of your elbow that may spread down your forearm.
This can cause: 

difficulty with gripping.
difficulty with twisting movements such as opening jars.
restriction in movement at the elbow.
tenderness when touching the area.

Golfer’s elbow symptoms develop when there’s a problem with the tendons around the elbow.  These tendons help with gripping activities.   
Activities that involve the use of these tendons can include:

gripping
writing
lifting
pulling
twisting

Repeated use of the muscles that help bend your wrist and fingers can cause changes to the tendon, often due to overloading it. 
Other factors that can affect tendon health include:

smoking 
obesity 
high fat diet  
high cholesterol levels  
diabetes (Type 1 and 2) 

In order for golfer’s elbow to be diagnosed you will need an assessment from a healthcare professional.
They’ll initially ask you questions about your elbow issue and then carry out a physical examination. This may include checking your range of movement and strength.
You may sometimes need to have a further examination to rule out other possible health conditions.
If your elbow pain is aggravated by certain movements try to reduce these by modifying your activity.  
You can modify your activity by:

changing how you grip or lift an object.
reducing the weight you are carrying.
taking regular breaks while doing aggravating activities.

As well as modifying your activities it’s important to start exercising your elbow.
Read about exercises for golfers elbow
Pain medication can help you move more comfortably, which can help your recovery.
More about taking painkillers.
Elbow support 
Some people find a elbow support, sometimes called an epiclasp, can be helpful to manage the pain caused by golfer’s elbow.
Research suggests they may be useful in the short term but overall there is limited evidence to support their use.
Corticosteroid Injection 
If exercise, modification of activity and painkillers aren’t helping to control the pain, your healthcare professional may discuss the option of having a corticosteroid injection into your elbow. However, current evidence has shown limited benefit for this type of condition and may be detrimental to the health of your tendon.
Corticosteroids are medicines that help reduce pain and inflammation. They may also be given with a local anaesthetic.
Injections won’t cure your condition, they are used to help with the pain.
Read more about corticosteroids
Golfers elbow can sometimes mean you need to take some time off work to help recovery. How long you’re off will depend on the nature of your condition and your role at work.
You do not need to be symptom free before you consider returning to work. Continuing to go to work, or returning to work as soon as is possible for you, will help your recovery. Gradually getting back to your normal daily activities can help to build up your strength and stamina levels.
Following this advice, you should see gradual improvements over time.
If your golfer’s elbow hasn’t improved, or it’s got worse, within 6 weeks of following this advice, it’s a good idea to talk to a healthcare professional about your symptoms.

Gonorrhoea,"Many people with gonorrhoea won’t notice any symptoms.
If you do get symptoms, it’s usually between 1 to 14 days after getting the infection.
Symptoms of gonorrhoea may include:

green or yellow fluid coming out of the penis
pain or a burning sensation when peeing
discomfort and swelling of the testicles
increased discharge from the vagina
pain in the lower tummy, particularly during sex
bleeding in between periods or after sex

Gonorrhoea can also infect the throat, eyes or anus. You may experience pain or discharge in these areas. Gonorrhoea in the throat usually has no symptoms.
Having the infection during pregnancy can result in giving birth to the baby early (premature birth). Gonorrhoea can be passed on to the baby during birth and can result in eye infections in the infant.
If you think you might have gonorrhoea, get tested for free by:

booking an appointment at your local sexual health service (if you have symptoms)
contacting your GP practice for an appointment (if you have symptoms)
ordering a home test kit (if you do not have symptoms)

Services available may vary depending on where you live.
The test for gonorrhoea is simple, painless and very reliable. It involves sending a sample from the area of the body thought to be infected to a lab for analysis.
You usually don’t have to be examined by a doctor or nurse and can often collect the sample yourself.
The 2 main ways the sample can be collected are:

using a swab – a small cotton bud is gently wiped over the area that might be infected, such as inside the vagina, throat, or inside the anus
urine sample (if you have a penis) – this is more accurate if it’s at least 1 or 2 hours after you last peed

People who have had anal or oral sex may have a swab taken from their anus or throat.
Some sexual health clinics may be able to carry out rapid tests and give you your test results straight away. Otherwise, you’ll have to wait up to 2 weeks to get the results.
If you have gonorrhoea, your partner will be offered testing and treatment.
Antibiotics will treat the gonorrhoea infection. These can be given in pill form or as an injection.
Some strains of gonorrhoea are becoming resistant to antibiotics. This can make it more difficult to treat. You may be tested again 3 weeks later to check the antibiotics have worked.
If there’s a high chance you have gonorrhoea, you may be given treatment before you get your results back.
You may also be offered treatment if your partner (s) is found to have gonorrhoea.
Tell the doctor or nurse if you:

are pregnant
think you might be pregnant
are breastfeeding

This may make a difference to the antibiotic you’re prescribed.
If your infection is untreated you may pass it on to other sexual partners.
If gonorrhoea is left untreated in women, it can spread to the womb and cause a serious condition called pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). This is a major cause of ectopic pregnancy and infertility in women.
If men are not treated, the infection may spread to the testicles and cause discomfort. This could affect your fertility.
Do not have sex until you and your partner have both finished the treatment. You should also wait until you’ve had the results of the 2 week test to prevent being infected again.
Gonorrhoea is passed through unprotected vaginal, anal or oral sex (without a condom).
It can also be passed on by:

sharing sex toys that aren’t washed or covered with a new condom each time they’re used
infected semen or vaginal fluid getting into your eye
it can also be passed to a newborn during childbirth

The best way to prevent all sexually transmitted infections is to practice safer sex. This means using a condom for vaginal, anal or oral sex.
If you have been diagnosed with gonorrhoea you should get tested for all STIs including:

syphilis
HIV
chlamydia
"
Gout,"Any joint can be affected by gout, but it usually affects joints towards the ends of the limbs, like

toes, especially the big toe
ankles
knees
fingers

Signs and symptoms of gout include:

severe pain in 1 or more joints
the joint feeling hot and very tender
swelling in and around the affected joint
red, shiny skin over the affected joint

Almost everyone with gout will experience further flares at some point, usually within a year.
Flares of gout tend to:

occur at night, but they can happen at any time
develop quickly over a few hours
last between 3 and 10 days
come back – you may experience flares every few months or years
become more frequent over time if not treated

After a gout flare the affected joint should start to return to normal. But, the problem can persist if treatment isn’t started early.
It’s difficult to predict how often flares will occur and when exactly they’ll happen.
Repeated gout flares can lead to joint pain and joint deformities.
Your GP will ask about your symptoms and medical history, and examine the affected area, to help make a diagnosis.
They may also ask you about your diet and whether there’s any history of gout in your family.
Sometimes further tests will be needed to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other possible causes."
Greater trochanteric pain syndrome,"These can vary from person to person.
People may experience some or all of these symptoms including:

Pain in the hip/thigh/buttock area.
Worse pain when lying on your side or with direct pressure.
Pain increasing with exercise such as periods of walking, standing or running.
Tenderness to touch.
Pain sitting with your legs crossed.
Pain when standing on the affected leg (sometimes called hanging on the hip)
Pain when climbing stairs
Pain when lifting legs in/out a car or bed

Often it can occur for no apparent reason but these are some factors which appear to contribute to it:

a sudden increased load on your hip
a change to your activity levels such as increased walking distances or pace
increased pressure to your hip area through sitting or standing in one position for too long or weight bearing on one leg
reduced strength and flexibility of the muscles around the hip and buttock
having a sedentary, inactive lifestyle or being overweight
an injury such as a fall on to the side of your hip area
hormone changes may also influence this condition
this can also be related to osteoarthritis of the hips and knees or low back pain

An important step in your recovery is identifying which activities are causing or increasing your pain. Modifying those activities can help to reduce symptoms.
The key to success is slow progressive loading of the soft tissues through exercise that strengthen the muscles involved.
Read more about exercises for greater trochanteric pain syndrome
Over time it is important to gradually increase the exercises to help the tendons and muscles become stronger, less painful and more able to cope with your normal activity levels.
Other ways to help improve symptoms include:

spreading your weight evenly across both feet and not leaning on just one leg.
avoiding low chairs.
avoid sitting with your legs crossed.
avoid sleeping on the painful side. Try lying on your back with a pillow under your knees or lie on your good side with a pillow between your legs to keep them in line with your hip joints.
try to keep active and stay at work even if you have to modify your duties.
losing weight if you are overweight.

This condition can often take 6 to 12 months of rehabilitation to settle, but this will depend on the cause.
It is normal to have flare ups during this time. If this happens, then it may be best to reduce the repetitions or rest for a few days before starting again.
Pain medication can help you move more comfortably, which can help your recovery.
More about taking painkillers 
If painkillers aren’t helping to control the pain, your healthcare professional may discuss the option of having a corticosteroid injection into the outer hip.
Corticosteroids are medicines that help reduce pain and inflammation. They may also be given with a local anaesthetic.
Injections may not cure your condition, they are used to help with the pain.

A hip problem can sometimes mean you need to take some time off work to help recovery. How long you’re off will depend on the nature of your condition and your role at work.
You do not need to be symptom free before you consider returning to work. Continuing to go to work, or returning to work as soon as is possible for you, will help your recovery. Gradually getting back to your normal daily activities can help to build up your strength and stamina levels.

Gum disease,"Healthy gums should be pink, firm and keep your teeth securely in place. Your gums shouldn’t bleed when you touch or brush them.
Gum disease isn’t always painful and you may be unaware you have it. It’s important to have regular dental check-ups.
The initial symptoms of gum disease can include:

red and swollen gums
bleeding gums after brushing or flossing your teeth

This stage of gum disease is called gingivitis.
If gingivitis is untreated, the tissues and bone that support the teeth can also become affected. This is known as periodontitis, or periodontal disease.
Symptoms of periodontitis can include:

bad breath (halitosis)
an unpleasant taste in your mouth
loose teeth that can make eating difficult
gum abscesses (collections of pus that develop under your gums or teeth)

In rare cases, a condition called acute necrotising ulcerative gingivitis (ANUG) can develop suddenly. The symptoms of ANUG are usually more severe than those of gum disease and can include:

bleeding, painful gums
painful ulcers
receding gums inbetween your teeth
bad breath
a metallic taste in your mouth
excess saliva in your mouth
difficulty swallowing or talking
a high temperature (fever)

You should make an appointment to see your dentist if you think you may have gum disease or ANUG.
If you don’t currently have a dentist, search for a dentist near you.

Haemorrhoids (piles),
"Hand, foot and mouth disease","The signs of hand, foot and mouth disease can include:

a high temperature (fever)
feeling unwell
loss of appetite
coughing
abdominal (tummy) pain
a sore throat and mouth

Source: dermnetnz.org
After 1 or 2 days, red spots appear on the tongue and inside the mouth.
These quickly develop into larger yellow-grey mouth ulcers with red edges.
The ulcers can be painful and make eating, drinking and swallowing difficult. They should pass within a week.
Soon after the mouth ulcers appear, you may notice a rash made up of small, raised red spots on the skin.
These can develop on the:

fingers
back of the hands
palms of the hand
soles of the feet
buttocks
groin

The spots may then turn into small blisters with a grey centre.
The spots and blisters can sometimes be itchy or uncomfortable and usually last up to 10 days.
Speak to your GP practice if you’re pregnant and you become infected within a few weeks of your due date. Infection in pregnancy is usually nothing to worry about. But, there’s a small chance it could make your baby ill if you’re infected shortly before you give birth.
Read more about the risks of hand, foot and mouth disease in pregnancy
Hand, foot and mouth disease can be unpleasant, but it will usually clear up by itself within 7 to 10 days. You can normally look after yourself or your child at home.
There’s no cure for hand, foot and mouth disease.
Antibiotics won’t help as hand, foot and mouth disease is caused by a virus.
You should keep your child away from nursery or school until they’re feeling better. Adults with the condition should stay away from work until they’re feeling better.
Hand, foot and mouth disease is easily passed on to other people. It’s spread through coughs, sneezes, poo and the fluid in blisters.
The infection is caused by many different viruses so you can get it more than once. Most people develop immunity to these viruses as they get older.
It’s not always possible to avoid getting hand, foot and mouth disease. But, following this advice can help stop the infection spreading."
Hay fever,"The symptoms of hay fever include:

frequent sneezing
runny or blocked nose
itchy, red or watery eyes (allergic conjunctivitis) 
an itchy throat, mouth, nose and ears
cough, caused by postnasal drip (mucus dripping down the throat from the back of the nose)

Less commonly, you may also experience:

the loss of your sense of smell (anosmia)
facial pain (caused by blocked sinuses)
headaches
earache
tiredness and fatigue

If you have asthma, your asthma symptoms may get worse when you have hay fever.
There’s currently no cure for hay fever. But most people can relieve symptoms with treatment, at least to a certain extent.
The most effective way to control hay fever would be to avoid exposure to pollen. However, it’s very difficult to avoid pollen, particularly during the summer months.
Treatment options for hay fever include:

antihistamines – which help to prevent an allergic reaction
corticosteroids (steroids) – which help to reduce inflammation and swelling

If you have hay fever, you can get advice and treatment from a pharmacist.
Hay fever can often be controlled using over-the-counter medication from your pharmacist.
For severe and persistent hay fever, there’s also a type of treatment called immunotherapy. It involves being exposed to small amounts of pollen over time. This builds resistance to pollen’s allergic effects. But it can take many months or even years to work.
You can get hay fever at any age. But it usually begins in childhood or during the teenage years. It’s more common in boys than girls. In adults, men and women are equally affected
You’re more likely to develop hay fever if you have a family history of allergies, particularly asthma or eczema.
It’s sometimes possible to prevent the symptoms of hay fever by taking some basic precautions.
Hay fever doesn’t pose a serious threat to health. But it can have a negative impact on your quality of life. Very severe hay fever may disrupt your productivity at school or work.
Inflammation of the sinuses (sinusitis) is another common complication of hay fever. Children may also develop a middle ear infection (otitis media) as a result of hay fever."
Head and neck cancer,
Head lice and nits,
Headaches,
Hearing loss,
Heart attack,
Heart block,"First degree heart block does not always cause any noticeable symptoms, and most people only become aware they have the condition when they are tested for an unrelated medical condition.
Most people with second degree Mobitz type 1 heart block will not experience any symptoms. However, some people may experience symptoms such as:

light-headedness
dizziness
fainting (temporary loss of consciousness)

People with second degree Mobitz type 2 heart blocks are much more likely to experience the symptoms listed above. They may also experience additional symptoms such as:

chest pain – which may be worse during physical activity, such as climbing the stairs
shortness of breath
tiring easily when undertaking physical activity
feeling very dizzy suddenly when standing up from a lying or sitting position – this is caused by having low blood pressure (hypotension)

Many cases of congenital third degree heart block are diagnosed during pregnancy because an ultrasound scan can often detect whether the baby has a slow heartbeat (bradycardia).
If the diagnosis is overlooked during pregnancy, the symptoms of congenital third degree heart block will not usually become apparent until the child is older and a greater demand is placed on their heart.
Symptoms of congenital third degree heart block in older infants or young children include:

unusually pale and blotchy skin
lethargy (lacking in energy)
unwillingness to take part in exercise or physical activity
dizziness
fainting

Symptoms of acquired third degree heart block include:

light-headedness
dizziness
fainting
fatigue
chest pain
slow heart beat (bradycardia)
"
Heart failure,
Heart palpitations,
Hepatitis A,"Some people with hepatitis A, particularly young children, won’t have any symptoms.
If you do develop symptoms, they tend to occur around 4 weeks after exposure to the hepatitis A virus.
Symptoms of hepatitis A include:

feeling tired and generally unwell
joint and muscle pain
a high temperature (fever)
loss of appetite
feeling or being sick
pain in the upper-right part of your tummy
a headache, sore throat and cough
constipation or diarrhoea
a raised, itchy rash (hives)
yellowing of the skin and eyes (jaundice)
dark pee
pale poo
itchy skin
the upper-right part of your tummy becoming swollen and tender

A blood test can check whether you have hepatitis A. It can also rule out other conditions that cause similar symptoms, but which may require treatment to prevent more serious problems.
Your friends, family and sexual partners may need to be tested too.
There’s currently no cure for hepatitis A. It will usually get better its own within a couple of months.
Once hepatitis A passes, you’ll normally be immune to it for life.
There are things you can do to help your symptoms and prevent the infection spreading to others.
Speak to your GP practice if your symptoms get worse or haven’t started to improve within a couple of months. They can prescribe medications to help with itchiness, nausea or vomiting, if needed.
Hepatitis A can occasionally last for many months.
In rare cases, it can be life-threatening if it causes liver failure. People most at risk include those with other liver problems and elderly people. If liver failure does occur, a liver transplant is usually needed to treat it.
Hepatitis A is most widespread in parts of the world where standards of cleanliness and food hygiene are poor.
You can get the infection from:

drinking unclean water
eating food that’s been washed or grown in unclean water
eating food that’s been handled by an infected person
close contact with someone who has hepatitis A
having sex with someone who has the infection – particularly if you touch their anus with your fingers, mouth or tongue
injecting drugs using unclean equipment

Someone with hepatitis A is most infectious from around 2 weeks before their symptoms appear until about 1 week after the symptoms first develop.
Vaccination is the best way to prevent hepatitis A.
The hepatitis A vaccine isn’t routinely offered in the UK because the risk of infection is low for most people.
It’s only recommended for people at increased risk, including:

close contacts of someone with hepatitis A
people planning to travel to or live in parts of the world where hepatitis A is widespread, particularly if levels of cleanliness and food hygiene are expected to be poor
people with any type of long-term (chronic) liver disease
men who have sex with other men
people who inject illegal drugs
people who may be exposed to hepatitis A through their job – for example sewage workers, staff at homeless shelters, and people working with monkeys, apes and gorillas
"
Hepatitis B,"Many people with hepatitis B won’t have any symptoms.
If you do develop symptoms, they tend to occur 2 or 3 months after exposure to the hepatitis B virus.
Symptoms of hepatitis B include:

tiredness
a high temperature (fever) of 38°C (100.4°F) or above
general aches and pains
loss of appetite
feeling and being sick
diarrhoea
abdominal pain
yellowing of the skin and eyes (jaundice)

A blood test can check if you have hepatitis B or have had it in the past. The hepatitis B vaccine may also be recommended to reduce your risk of infection.
Treatment for hepatitis B depends on how long you’ve been infected for.
If you’ve been exposed to the virus in the last few days, emergency treatment can help stop you becoming infected.
Acute hepatitis B means you’ve only had the infection for a few weeks or months. You may only need treatment to relieve your symptoms while your body fights off the infection itself.
Chronic hepatitis B means you’ve had the infection for more than 6 months. You may be offered medicines that can keep the virus under control and reduce the risk of liver damage.
Chronic hepatitis B often requires:

long-term or lifelong treatment
regular checks for any further liver problems

The hepatitis B virus is found in the blood, semen and vaginal fluids and bodily fluids of an infected person.
It can be spread by:

a mother to her newborn baby, particularly in countries where the infection is common
within families (child to child) in countries where the infection is common
injecting drugs and sharing needles and other drug equipment, such as spoons and filters
having sex with an infected person without using a condom
having a tattoo, body piercing, or medical or dental treatment with unsterilised equipment
sharing toothbrushes, razors or scissors contaminated with infected blood

Hepatitis B is not spread by kissing, holding hands, hugging, coughing, sneezing, or sharing crockery and utensils.
A vaccine that offers protection against hepatitis B is available for all babies born in the UK on or after 1 August 2017. It’s also available for people at high risk of the infection or complications from it.
People at high risk of hepatitis B include:

babies born to mothers with hepatitis B
close family and sexual partners of someone with hepatitis B
people travelling to a part of the world where hepatitis B is widespread
families adopting or fostering children from high-risk countries
people who inject drugs or have a sexual partner who injects drugs
people who change their sexual partner often
men who have sex with men
male and female sex workers
people whose job puts them at risk of contact with blood or body fluids, such as nurses, prison staff, doctors, dentists and laboratory staff
people with chronic liver disease
people with chronic kidney disease
people in prison
people receiving regular blood or blood products, and their carers

NHS Scotland is making the blood supply safer by introducing enhanced hepatitis B screening. This is an additional measure to improve testing for blood donors and further increase the safety of the blood supply chain.
NHS Scotland has been conducting this enhanced screening on all donations since April 2022. Only a small number of donors are impacted, however, these donors will no longer be able to donate.
As well as medical treatments, there are some things you can do when you have hepatitis B to help ease the symptoms and stop the infection spreading to others.
Your close contacts, such as family members, may need to be vaccinated.
Most people do not have any lasting problems after having a hepatitis B infection.
In some patients chronic hepatitis B can cause liver damage (cirrhosis) and increase your risk of getting liver cancer.
It is important that all patients with chronic hepatitis B are followed up in specialist clinics. If required, treatment can control hepatitis B infection, preventing serious complications."
Hepatitis C,"Many people with hepatitis C won’t have any symptoms until the liver has been significantly damaged. This means many people have the infection without knowing.
Most people will not have symptoms during the first 6 months of a hepatitis C infection. This stage is known as acute hepatitis C.
If symptoms do develop, they usually occur a few weeks after infection.
Early symptoms may include:

a high temperature (fever) of 38°C (100.4°F) or above
tiredness
loss of appetite
abdominal pain
feeling and being sick
yellowing of the skin and eyes (jaundice)

Symptoms can vary from person to person. They can also go away for long periods of time and then return.
Later symptoms may include:

feeling tired all the time
joint and muscle aches and pain
feeling sick
brain fog – including problems with memory, concentration and mental tasks such as arithmetic
mood swings
depression or anxiety
indigestion or bloating
itchy skin
abdominal pain

The only way to know for certain if these symptoms are caused by hepatitis C is to get tested.
You can get tested for hepatitis C at:

your GP practice
a sexual health clinic
a drug treatment service
most substance use recovery services

Treatment takes 8 to 12 weeks, and usually cures the infection. But you won’t be immune to hepatitis C. So you should take steps to reduce your risk of becoming infected again.
If the infection is diagnosed early (acute hepatitis), you may not need treatment straight away. Instead, you may have another blood test after a few months to see if your body fights off the virus itself.
If the infection continues for several months (chronic hepatitis), treatment will usually be recommended.
There are things you can do to stop liver damage and prevent the infection spreading to others before you start treatment.
You can become infected with hepatitis C if you come into contact with the blood of an infected person.
Some ways the infection can be spread include:

injecting drugs and sharing needles and other drug equipment, such as spoons and filters
sharing toothbrushes, razors or scissors contaminated with infected blood
from a pregnant woman to her unborn baby
having sex with an infected person without using a condom – if your partner has hepatitis C, you should be tested
having a tattoo, body piercing, or medical or dental treatment with unsterilised equipment
if you had a blood transfusion in Scotland before 1996, you may have been exposed to hepatitis C – all donor blood in Scotland has been screened for hepatitis C since September 1991, however there is an extremely small possibility that some infections may have occurred from blood transfusions after universal screening was introduced but before a reporting system for transfusion risks began in 1996

There’s no vaccine for hepatitis C.
There are things you can do to reduce your risk of becoming infected.
The risk of getting hepatitis C through vaginal sex is very low. It may be higher if blood is present, such as period (menstrual) blood or from bleeding during anal sex.
If left untreated for many years, hepatitis C can cause liver damage (cirrhosis). In severe cases, life-threatening problems such as liver failure or liver cancer can eventually develop.
Early treatment of hepatitis C prevents these serious complications, while later treatment reduces the risk."
Hiatus hernia,
High blood pressure (hypertension),"High blood pressure often has no symptoms. So, if you think you may have high blood pressure, or you’re on medication for it, you should check your blood pressure regularly.
In rare cases, high blood pressure may cause symptoms.
Some GP practices now will now provide you with a blood pressure monitor to take home. This is because:

your blood pressure can change throughout the day
anxiety or stress can raise your blood pressure

A home blood pressure monitor can be used to measure your blood pressure levels over time. You can can use the monitor at a time that suits you.
A healthcare professional may take blood and urine tests along with blood pressure checks. This is to check for conditions that can cause an increase in blood pressure like kidney disease.
Making lifestyle changes can sometimes help if you have high blood pressure.
Sometimes a combination of treatments is needed to treat high blood pressure. This means you may have to take more than one type of medication in addition to making healthy lifestyle changes.
The most common medications for high blood pressure are:

angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors – like ramapril
calcium channel blockers – like amlodipine
thiazide diuretics – like bendroflumethazide
alpha-blockers – like doxazosin
beta-blockers – like atenolol

If you have high blood pressure, you may have to take medication to treat it for the rest of your life. But, the effect of medication and your lifestyle on your blood pressure should be monitored over time.
If it’s left untreated, high blood pressure can cause problems including:

stroke
heart attack
arterial thrombosis
abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA)
kidney disease
vascular dementia

High cholesterol,
HIV,"Most people experience a short flu-like illness 2 to 6 weeks after infection, which lasts for 2 weeks. This is known as primary HIV infection.
Symptoms of primary HIV infection include:

fever (high temperature)
sore throat
body rash

Other symptoms can include:

tiredness
joint pain
muscle pain
swollen glands

After these symptoms disappear, HIV may not cause symptoms for many years. During this time, HIV continues to be active and causes damage to your immune system.
This means many people who have HIV do not know they’re infected.
Once the immune system becomes severely damaged symptoms can include:

weight loss
chronic diarrhoea
night sweats
skin problems
recurrent infections
serious life-threatening illnesses

If you think you might have HIV, get tested for free by:

booking an appointment at your local sexual health service
contacting your GP practice for an appointment
ordering a home test kit
contacting clinics run by charities such as the Terrence Higgins Trust or Waverley Care Scotland for an appointment
contacting local drug dependency services for an appointment

Services available may vary depending on where you live.
Some private clinics may offer HIV testing, but they may charge.
Anyone who thinks they may have HIV should get tested.
Certain groups of people are at a higher risk and are advised to have regular tests. For example:

gay and bisexual men or men who have sex with men should have an HIV test at least once a year, or every 3 months if having sex without HIV PrEP or condoms with new or casual partners
women and men from countries with high HIV prevalence, especially from sub-Saharan Africa, should have an HIV test if having sex without using HIV PrEP or condoms with new or casual partners
people who inject drugs or have unprotected sex (sex without condoms or HIV PrEP) with people who inject drugs

The test for HIV is straightforward, highly accurate and is the only way to know if you’re infected. It involves taking a sample from the body for analysis.
There are 4 main types of HIV test.
Where a sample of blood is taken and sent to a lab for analysis. Results are usually available within a few days.
A sample of saliva from your mouth or a small spot of blood from your finger is taken. This sample doesn’t need to be sent to a lab and the result is available within a few minutes. Anyone who has a reactive point of care test still needs a confirmed laboratory test.
Where you collect a saliva sample or small spot of blood at home and send it off in the post for analysis. You’ll be contacted by phone or text with your result in a few days. You can buy them online or from some pharmacies. Anyone who has a reactive home testing kit result is still required to have a laboratory confirmed test.
Where you collect a saliva sample or small spot of blood yourself and test it at home. The result is available within minutes. Check that any test you buy has a CE quality assurance mark and is licensed for sale in the UK.
Antiretroviral medicines are used to treat HIV. They work by stopping the virus multiplying in the body, allowing the immune system to repair itself and prevent further damage.
These come in tablet form and must be taken every day.
Most people with HIV take a combination of medicines.
The goal of HIV treatment is to have an undetectable viral load. This means the level of HIV virus in your body is low enough to not be detected by a test.
People who take HIV treatment and whose virus level is undetectable can’t pass HIV on to others. Although there is no cure for HIV yet, people living with HIV who take their treatment should have a normal lifespan and good health.
Without treatment, people with HIV will eventually become unwell. HIV can be fatal if it’s not detected and treated in time to allow the immune system to repair. It’s extremely important to test for HIV if you think you’ve been exposed.
You can get HIV by having unprotected vaginal or anal sex (sex without a condom or not taking HIV PrEP). It may be possible for HIV to be passed on through unprotected oral sex, but the risk is very low.
Other ways of getting HIV include:

sharing sex toys that aren’t washed or covered with a new condom each time they’re used
sharing needles, syringes and other injecting equipment
from mother to baby before or during birth when the mother isn’t taking HIV medication
from mother to baby by breastfeeding when the mother isn’t taking HIV medication
blood transfusion (outside of the UK)

People who are at higher risk of becoming infected with HIV include people who are not taking HIV PrEP medication and who are:

men who have had unprotected anal sex with men
women who have had unprotected sex with men who have sex with men
people who have had unprotected sex with a person who has lived or travelled in a high HIV prevalence country
people who inject drugs
people who have had unprotected sex with somebody who has injected drugs
people who have caught another sexually transmitted infection (STI)

The best way to reduce your risk of STIs is to practice safer sex. This means using a condom for vaginal, anal and oral sex. If you’re having anal sex it’s important to also use water-based or silicon-based lubricant.
Taking HIV PrEP before you’re exposed to HIV means there’s a drug inside of you to block HIV if it gets into your body, so it can’t infect you.
If you think you may have recently been exposed to HIV and you haven’t taken HIV PrEP medication or used a condom, you should take PEP medication.
PEP is a form of emergency HIV medication taken by someone who does not have HIV but who has or may have been very recently exposed to HIV.
PEP should be taken as soon as possible, but it can be taken up to 72 hours after exposure. The earlier it is taken the more effective it is.
PEP is available from sexual health services or out of hours from A&E.
If you inject drugs, you should never share needles or other injecting equipment (including syringes, spoons and swabs).
You can get free clean needles and other injecting equipment from your local injecting equipment providers, which are sometimes also called needle exchanges.
If you’ve been diagnosed with HIV you should get tested for all STIs and blood borne viruses including:

chlamydia
gonorrhoea
syphilis
hepatitis B
hepatitis C
"
Hodgkin lymphoma,"The most common symptom of Hodgkin lymphoma is a swelling in the neck, armpit or groin. The swelling is usually painless, although some people find that it aches.
The swelling is caused by an excess of affected lymphocytes (white blood cells) collecting in a lymph node (also called lymph glands). Lymph nodes are pea-sized lumps of tissue found throughout the body. They contain white blood cells that help to fight infection.
However, it’s highly unlikely that you have Hodgkin lymphoma if you have swollen lymph nodes, as these glands often swell as a response to infection.
Some people with Hodgkin lymphoma also have other more general symptoms. These can include:

night sweats
unintentional weight loss
a high temperature (fever)
a persistent cough or feeling of breathlessness
persistent itching of the skin all over the body

Other symptoms will depend on where in the body the enlarged lymph glands are. For example, if the abdomen (tummy) is affected, you may have abdominal pain or indigestion
A few people with lymphoma have abnormal cells in their bone marrow when they’re diagnosed. This may lead to:

persistent tiredness or fatigue
an increased risk of infections
excessive bleeding – such as nosebleeds, heavy periods and spots of blood under the skin

In some cases, people with Hodgkin lymphoma experience pain in their lymph glands when they drink alcohol.
Speak to your GP if you have any of these symptoms, particularly if you have persistently swollen glands with no other signs of infection.
While the symptoms are unlikely to be caused by Hodgkin lymphoma, it is best to get them checked out."
Hodgkin lymphoma: Children,
Hodgkin lymphoma: Teenagers and young adults,"One of the most common symptoms is having a painless lump. The lump is caused by swollen lymph nodes. There may be one or more lumps and these may be in your neck, armpit or groin.
Lumps can also be inside the body. A commonplace would be inside the chest and this can cause a cough or breathlessness.
Some people feel tired and lethargic with lymphoma. Itching of the skin is also quite common.
Some people with Hodgkin lymphoma have other symptoms such as high temperatures, very heavy sweats (especially at night) and unexplained weight loss. Doctors call these symptoms ‘B symptoms’.
Most of the symptoms that people get with lymphoma may also be caused by other illnesses. For example swollen lymph nodes, high temperatures and sweats may be caused by an infection. But if you have any of these symptoms or are worried that you may have Hodgkin lymphoma, go to your GP. They’ll examine you and refer you to a hospital if they think you need to see a specialist doctor."
Huntington’s disease,"People can start to show the symptoms of Huntington’s disease at almost any age. Most will develop problems between the ages of 30 and 50.
The condition gradually gets worse for around 10-25 years, until the person dies.
Behavioural changes are often the first symptoms of Huntington’s disease. These changes often include:

a lack of emotions and not recognising the needs of others
periods of aggression, excitement, depression, antisocial behaviour and anger
apathy – causing a person to appear lazy or have a lack of interest in hygiene and self care
difficulty concentrating on more than one task and handling complex situations
irritability and impulsiveness

Further symptoms of Huntington’s might include:

psychiatric problems – some people develop obsessive behaviours, delusional thoughts or behaviours, stubborness, lack of self awareness, or suicidal thoughts
uncontrollable movements of the face, jerking, clicking or fidgety movements of the limbs and body
difficulty eating because the mouth and throat muscles don’t work properly which can lead to choking and chest infections
communication problems – difficulty putting thoughts into words and slurring of speech
sexual problems – a loss of interest in sex or making inappropriate sexual demands
balance problems

In the later stages of Huntington’s disease, the person will need full nursing care.
Death is usually from a secondary cause, like pneumonia or another infection.
You might find the palliative care section useful if you’re caring for someone who’s dying, or if you want to plan your end of life care.
Juvenile Huntington’s disease is a rare form of the condition that can occur in people under the age of 20. Common signs include:

a rapid decline in school performance
changes in handwriting
problems with movement, such as slowness, stiffness, tremor or muscle twitching (similar to the features of Parkinson’s disease)
seizures (fits)
"
Hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar),"Symptoms of hyperglycaemia in people with diabetes tend to develop slowly over a few days or weeks. In some cases, there may be no symptoms until the blood sugar level is very high.
Symptoms of hyperglycaemia include:

increased thirst and a dry mouth
needing to pee frequently
tiredness
blurred vision
unintentional weight loss
recurrent infections, such as thrush, bladder infections (cystitis) and skin infections

Symptoms of hyperglycaemia can also be due to undiagnosed diabetes, so see your GP if this applies to you. You can have a test to check for the condition.
When you’re first diagnosed with diabetes, your diabetes care team will usually tell you what your blood sugar level is and what you should aim to get it down to.
You may be advised to use a testing device to monitor your blood sugar level regularly at home, or you may have an appointment with a nurse or doctor every few months to see what your level is.
Target blood sugar levels differ for everyone, but generally speaking:

if you monitor yourself at home – a normal target is 4-7mmol/l before eating and under 8.5-9mmol/l two hours after a meal
if you’re tested every few months – a normal target is below 48mmol/mol (or 6.5% on the older measurement scale)

A variety of things can trigger an increase in blood sugar level in people with diabetes, including:

stress
an illness, such as a cold
eating too much, such as snacking between meals
a lack of exercise 
dehydration
missing a dose of your diabetes medication, or taking an incorrect dose
over-treating an episode of hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar)
taking certain medicines, such as steroid medication

Occasional episodes of hyperglycaemia can also occur in children and young adults during growth spurts.
If you’ve been diagnosed with diabetes and you have symptoms of hyperglycaemia, follow the advice your care team has given you to reduce your blood sugar level.
If you’re not sure what to do, contact your GP or care team.
You may be advised to:

change your diet – for example, you may be advised to avoid foods that cause your blood sugar levels to rise, such as cakes or sugary drinks
drink plenty of sugar-free fluids – this can help if you’re dehydrated
exercise more often – gentle, regular exercise such as walking can often lower your blood sugar level, particularly if it helps you lose weight
if you use insulin, adjust your dose – your care team can give you specific advice about how to do this

You may also be advised to monitor your blood sugar level more closely, or test your blood or urine for substances called ketones (associated with diabetic ketoacidosis).
Until your blood sugar level is back under control, watch out for additional symptoms that could be a sign of a more serious condition (see below).
Contact your diabetes care team immediately if you have a high blood sugar level and experience the following symptoms:

feeling or being sick
abdominal (tummy) pain 
rapid, deep breathing
signs of dehydration, such as a headache, dry skin and a weak, rapid heartbeat
difficulty staying awake

These symptoms could be a sign of diabetic ketoacidosis or a hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic state (see above) and you may need to be looked after in hospital.
There are simple ways to reduce your risk of severe or prolonged hyperglycaemia:

Be careful what you eat – be particularly aware of how snacking and eating sugary foods or carbohydrates can affect your blood sugar level.
Stick to your treatment plan – remember to take your insulin or other diabetes medications as recommended by your care team.
Be as active as possible – getting regular exercise can help stop your blood sugar level rising, but you should check with your doctor first if you’re taking diabetes medication, as some medicines can lead to hypoglycaemia if you exercise too much
Take extra care when you’re ill – your care team can provide you with some “sick day rules” that outline what you can do to keep your blood sugar level under control during an illness.
Monitor your blood sugar level – your care team may suggest using a device to check your level at home, so you can spot an increase early and take steps to stop it.
"
Hyperhidrosis,
Hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar),"The symptoms of hypoglycaemia usually begin when your blood glucose level drops below four millimoles (mmol) per litre.
If you have diabetes, particularly if it’s treated with insulin, you may be advised to use a small device called a blood glucose meter to regularly check your blood glucose levels.
Symptoms can vary from person to person, and it’s important to be aware of the early warning signs so you can treat them.
Signs and symptoms of hypoglycaemia can include:

feeling hungry
sweating
dizziness
tiredness (fatigue)
blurred vision
trembling or shakiness
going pale
fast pulse or palpitations
tingling lips
irritability
difficulty concentrating
confusion
disorderly or irrational behaviour, which may be mistaken for drunkenness

If hypoglycaemia isn’t treated promptly and your blood glucose levels drop low enough, you may become drowsy or even lose consciousness.
Most people with insulin-treated diabetes notice that the symptoms of hypoglycaemia change and become less obvious the longer they live with the condition.
For some people, the warning symptoms become greatly reduced, putting them at significant risk of having severe episodes where they’re dependent on others for help.
Let your diabetes care team know if you develop this problem as your treatment may need to be changed to reduce the risk.
Read more about how hypoglycaemia is treated
Having a hypo while you’re asleep is known as nocturnal hypoglycaemia. It’s more common in people who treat diabetes with insulin.
Although some people find their sleep is disturbed when they experience nocturnal hypoglycaemia, you may only notice the symptoms when you wake up in the morning.
The symptoms of nocturnal hypoglycaemia can include:

headache – often likened to having a hangover
feeling unusually tired in the morning
damp sheets or clothing from sweating
"
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis,"The symptoms of IPF tend to develop gradually and get slowly worse over time.
Symptoms can include:

shortness of breath
a persistent dry cough
tiredness
loss of appetite and weight loss
rounded and swollen fingertips (clubbed fingers)

Many people ignore their breathlessness at first and blame it on getting old or being out of shape. But eventually even light activity like getting dressed can cause shortness of breath.
The strain IPF can put on your lungs and heart increases the risk of secondary conditions, like:

chest infections and airway infections, for example bronchitis, pneumonia and influenza (flu)
pulmonary hypertension
right sided heart failure

Your GP may ask if you:

smoke, or smoked in the past
have been exposed to harmful substances at work, such as asbestos
have other medical conditions

They may also:

check the sound of your breathing through a stethoscope – a crackling sound can suggest lung scarring (fibrosis)
look at your fingers to see if the ends are swollen (finger clubbing)
ask you to walk around for a few minutes to see if you become breathless
arrange a chest X-ray

If your GP thinks you could have a lung condition like IPF, they can refer you to a hospital specialist for tests such as:

lung (pulmonary function) tests to check how well your lungs work
blood tests
a computerised tomography (CT) scan to see if there’s anything causing your symptoms like cancer, a build up of fluid or scarring

Usually, IPF is diagnosed without the need for additional tests. Sometimes your specialist may consider other tests such as:

bronchoscopy (where a narrow, flexible tube with a camera is passed down into your airways) to look for anything abnormal and take a tissue sample for testing
a lung biopsy (where a small piece of lung tissue is removed during keyhole surgery so it can be analysed)
an echocardiogram

There’s currently no cure for IPF, but there are several treatments that can help relieve the symptoms and slow down its progression.
Treatments include:

lifestyle changes – such as stopping smoking, eating healthily and exercising regularly
medication such as pirfenidone and nintedanib to reduce the rate at which scarring worsens – often your specialist team will monitor you, your breathing tests and your scan to see if your condition is progressing over time before starting treatment
breathing oxygen through a mask – if your oxygen levels are low when you’re resting, your specialist team may recommend wearing oxygen all the time, but if they are only low when you move around around, you may only need this when you are out and about
pulmonary rehabilitation – exercises and advice to help you breathe more easily
a lung transplant – this is suitable in a few cases, although donor lungs are rare and patients have to be otherwise very fit to benefit from a transplant
"
If your child has cold or flu symptoms,
Impetigo,"There are 2 types of impetigo:

non-bullous impetigo – the most common type
bullous impetigo

The symptoms of non-bullous impetigo begin with the appearance of red sores – usually around the nose and mouth but other areas of the face and the limbs can also be affected.
The sores quickly burst leaving behind thick, golden crusts typically around 2cm across. The appearance of these crusts is sometimes likened to cornflakes stuck to the skin.
After the crusts dry, they leave a red mark that usually fades without scarring. The time it takes for the redness to disappear can vary between a few days and a few weeks.
The sores aren’t painful, but they may be itchy. It’s important not to touch or scratch the sores because this can spread the infection to other parts of the body, and to other people.
Other symptoms, such as a high temperature (fever) and swollen glands, are rare but can occur in more severe cases.
The symptoms of bullous impetigo begin with the appearance of fluid-filled blisters (bullae) which usually occur on the central part of the body between the waist and neck, or on the arms and legs. The blisters are usually about 1cm to 2cm across.
The blisters may quickly spread, before bursting after several days to leave a yellow crust that usually heals without leaving any scarring.
The blisters may be painful and the area of skin surrounding them may be itchy. As with non-bullous impetigo, it’s important not to touch or scratch the affected areas of the skin.
Symptoms of fever and swollen glands are more common in cases of bullous impetigo.
Impetigo isn’t usually serious and can be treated by a pharmacist. Your pharmacist may recommend that you contact your GP practice if required."
Indigestion,"The main symptom of indigestion is pain or a feeling of discomfort in your upper abdomen (dyspepsia). People often experience the associated feeling of burning behind the breastbone (heartburn), but this may occur on its own.
These symptoms usually come on soon after eating or drinking, although there can sometimes be a delay between eating a meal and experiencing indigestion.
Heartburn is caused by acid that passes from your stomach into your gullet (oesophagus).
If you have indigestion, you may also have symptoms such as:

feeling uncomfortably full or heavy
belching or flatulence(passing wind)
bringing food or fluid back up from your stomach (reflux)
bloating
feeling sick (nausea)
vomiting
"
Ingrown toenail,"An ingrown toenail often affects the big toe, either on one or both sides. The nail curls and pierces the skin which becomes red, swollen and tender.
Other possible symptoms include:

pain if pressure is placed on the toe
inflammation of the skin at the end of the toe
a build-up of fluid (oedema) in the area surrounding the toe
an overgrowth of skin around the affected toe (hypertrophy)
bleeding
white or yellow pus coming from the affected area

If you have an ingrown toenail, you can ask a pharmacist about:

treatments to help ease the pain and prevent an infection
whether you need to see a GP
"
Infertility,
Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD),
Inherited heart conditions,"An inherited heart condition can cause symptoms like:

dizzy spells
blackouts, faints or fits (seizures)
palpitations
breathlessness
chest pain

It’s important to speak to your GP or a healthcare professional if you have had any of these symptoms.
An inherited heart condition can also cause cardiac arrest and sudden cardiac death. As some affected people don’t have symptoms, this means that sometimes the first time a family is aware that they’re affected by an inherited heart condition is after a sudden cardiac death.
There are 3 main groups of inherited heart conditions:
Inherited cardiomyopathies affect the heart muscle. Examples include:

Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM)
Dilated Cardiomyopathy (DCM)
Arrhythmogenic Cardiomyopathy

Inherited channelopathies affect the heart’s electrical system and heart rhythm. Examples include:

Long QT Syndrome
Brugada Syndrome
Catecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia (CPVT)

Aortopathy can affect the aorta, which is the main artery in the body. Examples include:

Marfan Syndrome
Loeys-Dietz syndrome

Sudden Arrhythmic Death Syndrome (SADS) is when someone dies suddenly or unexpectedly with no clear cause.
SADS can occur when there’s an abnormal heart rhythm, known as an arrhythmia. This causes a cardiac arrest where the heart stops beating.
A cardiac arrest is a medical emergency – find out more about what to do in a heart emergency.
The British Heart Foundation has information on genetic cardiac conditions and the procedures after a sudden death.
Cardiac Risk in the Young (CRY) has information on sudden cardiac death.
The process for testing for inherited heart conditions may differ from person to person. It will also be personalised to you and your family’s needs.
To begin the process, a specialist will ask questions about you and your family history. They may then refer you for heart tests, which can include:

an ECG (electrocardiogram)
an echocardiogram
a 24 hour heart monitor
an exercise tolerance test
a cardiac MRI scan

Every inherited heart condition is managed and treated differently. Treatments will be based on your symptoms and any test results.
Treatments may include:

changes to your lifestyle
medication
pacemakers or implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs)
heart transplantation (in rare cases)

Genetic services in Scotland are managed by specialist hospital doctors in 4 regional centres. These are:

Aberdeen – gram.clinicalgenetics@nhs.scot
Dundee – tay.clinicalgenetics@nhs.scot
Edinburgh – wgh.clinicalgenetics@nhslothian.scot.nhs.uk
Glasgow – ggc.wosicc@ggc.scot.nhs.uk

These regional services have access to:

specialist cardiologists
geneticists
specialist nursing
genetic counselling

These cardiac-genetic services link with the other hospitals in their regions.
You may need to visit your GP to get a referral to a specialist service.
The Network for Inherited Cardiac Conditions Scotland (NICCS) is a National Managed Clinical Network (NMCN). It was set up to help coordinate services for people with, or suspected of having, inherited heart conditions.
NICCS is part of the NHS. It brings together experts from across Scotland and aims to improve services for inherited heart conditions. Those in the network include:

heart specialists
geneticists
genetic counsellors
pathologists
specialist nurses
public representatives
other experts

The NICCS website has resources for people affected by inherited heart conditions. This includes a patient forum made up of patients, family members and organisations with an interest in inherited heart conditions.
If you’d like to find out more about NICCS, visit their website or email nss.niccs@nhs.scot.
Living with an inherited heart condition can be distressing for those affected and their families. There are many patient organisations and charities that can provide support and further information. This includes:

Cardiac Risk in the Young (CRY)
British Heart Foundation
Cardiomyopathy UK
Life After Cardiac Arrest
SADS UK
Arrhythmia Alliance UK
Cruse Scotland Bereavement Support
Sudden Cardiac Arrest UK (SCA UK)

Insomnia,"If you have insomnia, you might:

find it hard to fall asleep
lie awake at night
wake up several times during the night
wake up early in the morning and not be able to get back to sleep
not feel refreshed when you get up
feel tired and irritable during the day
have difficulty concentrating because you’re tired

Occasional episodes of insomnia can come and go without causing any serious problems. But, some people can have insomnia for months or even years at a time.
Persistent insomnia can have an impact on your quality of life. It can limit what you’re able to do during the day and affect your mood. It also can lead to relationship problems with friends, family and colleagues.
Everyone needs different amounts of sleep. 
Most adults sleep for 7 to 9 hours a night. Children and babies may sleep for much longer than this, whereas older adults may sleep less. What’s important is whether you feel you get enough sleep, and whether your sleep is good quality.
You’re probably not getting enough good-quality sleep if:

you always feel tired throughout the day
tiredness is affecting your everyday life

Insomnia can be triggered by many factors. It’s not always possible to identify a clear cause.
The most common causes of insomnia are: 

stress, anxiety and depression 
noise
a room that’s too hot or cold 
uncomfortable bed
alcohol, caffeine or drugs
jet lag 
shift work 

If you feel unwell or think your sleep problems could be caused by medication please speak to your GP or pharmacist
Because the causes of insomnia vary, the treatments used can vary from person to person.
Insomnia can often be treated by improving your sleep hygiene.
To improve your sleep hygiene, you need to look at both your sleep environment and your daily behaviours.
If you find you cannot fall asleep and you’re growing anxious about it, you should:

get up and go to a different room
do a relaxing activity, like reading or listening to music
try going to sleep again in around 20 minutes, or whenever you feel tired again

Your GP will first try to identify and treat any underlying health condition that may be causing your sleep problems. If it’s possible to identify an underlying cause of your sleeping difficulties, treating this may be enough to return your sleep to normal.
You could try our sleep problems and insomnia self-help guide. It covers topics like:

symptom of a sleep problem
causes of a sleep problem
improving your sleep
calming a busy mind

You could try an online course like Sleepio. Sleepio is a digital sleep improvement programme based on Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT.) It’s clinically proven to help address the root causes of poor sleep and insomnia.
If changing your sleeping habits doesn’t help, your GP may refer you for a type of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) for people with insomnia. This is called CBT-I.
CBT-I aims to change unhelpful thoughts and behaviours that contribute to insomnia. It’s an effective treatment for many people and can have long-lasting results.
In some circumstances, medication over the counter or on prescription can be used to help with insomnia.
Medication can be effective in the short term but it can also cause insomnia to get worse, cause addiction, or other side effects."
Iron deficiency anaemia,"Many people with iron deficiency anaemia only have a few symptoms. The severity of the symptoms largely depends on how quickly anaemia develops.
You may notice symptoms immediately, or they may develop gradually if your anaemia is caused by a long-term problem, such as a stomach ulcer.
The most common symptoms include:

tiredness and lack of energy (lethargy)
shortness of breath
noticeable heartbeats (heart palpitations)
a pale complexion

Less common symptoms include:

headache 
hearing sounds that come from inside the body, rather than from an outside source (tinnitus)
an altered sense of taste
feeling itchy
a sore or abnormally smooth tongue
hair loss
a desire to eat non-food items, such as ice, paper or clay (pica)
difficulty swallowing (dysphagia)
painful open sores (ulcers) on the corners of your mouth
spoon-shaped nails

See your GP if you experience symptoms of iron deficiency anaemia. They should be able to diagnose the condition using a simple blood test.
Read more about diagnosing iron deficiency anaemia
There are many things that can lead to a lack of iron in the body. In men and post-menopausal women, the most common cause is bleeding in the stomach and intestines.
This can be caused by a stomach ulcer, stomach cancer, bowel cancer, or by taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).
In women of reproductive age, heavy periods and pregnancy are the most common causes of iron deficiency anaemia as your body needs extra iron for your baby during pregnancy.
Unless you’re pregnant, it’s rare for iron deficiency anaemia to be caused just by a lack of iron in your diet. However, if you do lack dietary iron, it may mean you’re more likely to develop anaemia than if you have one of the problems mentioned above.
Read more about the causes of iron deficiency anaemia
Treatment for iron deficiency anaemia involves taking iron supplements to boost the low levels of iron in your body. This is usually effective, and the condition rarely causes long-term problems.
You’ll need to be monitored every few months to check the treatment is working and your iron levels have returned to normal.
The underlying cause will need to be treated so you don’t get anaemia again. Increasing the amount of iron in your diet may also be recommended.
Good sources of iron include:

dark-green leafy vegetables, such as watercress and curly kale
iron-fortified cereals or bread
brown rice 
pulses and beans
nuts and seeds
meat, fish and tofu
eggs
dried fruit, such as dried apricots, prunes and raisins

Read more about treating iron deficiency anaemia
If iron deficiency anaemia is left untreated, it can make you more susceptible to illness and infection, as a lack of iron affects the body’s natural defence system (the immune system).
Severe iron deficiency anaemia may increase your risk of developing complications that affect the heart or lungs, such as an abnormally fast heartbeat (tachycardia) or heart failure, where your heart is unable to pump enough blood around your body at the right pressure.
Pregnant women with severe or untreated anaemia also have a higher risk of complications before and after birth.

Joint hypermobility,"Many people with hypermobile joints don’t have any problems. For some people the extra flexibility may be a benefit. For example ballet dancers or gymnasts.
But, some people with joint hypermobility can have symptoms like:

pain and stiffness in the joints and muscles
clicking joints
joints that dislocate (come out of the correct position) easily
fatigue (extreme tiredness)
recurrent injuries – like sprains
digestive problems – like constipation and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)
dizziness and fainting
thin or stretchy skin

If you have these symptoms with hypermobility, this could be a sign of:

hypermobile Ehlers Danlos Syndrome (hEDS)
Hypermobility Spectrum Disorder (HSD)

A person with hEDS or HSD may also have some other symptoms related to stretchiness in the connective tissues throughout their body. The severity can differ from one person to another.
hEDS or HSD can cause symptoms that affect your digestive system. This is because the connective tissue within your digestive system is more stretchy. This makes squeezing food either more difficult or quicker causing a range of problems including:

gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD)
gastroparesis – where the stomach has difficulty emptying its contents into the small bowel which can cause bloating and nausea
constipation
irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)

hEDS or HSD can also cause abnormalities in the part of your nervous system that controls bodily functions you do not actively think about. These are things like your heart beating. This is known as your autonomic nervous system.
These abnormalities can cause problems when you stand up or sit in the same position for a while. Your blood pressure can drop to low levels, making you feel sick, dizzy and sweaty. You may also faint.
In some people, these abnormalities can lead to postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS). POTS causes your pulse rate to increase rapidly within a few minutes of standing up. You may also experience:

dizziness or fainting
headaches
tummy upsets
sweating
a sensation of anxiety
purple puffy fingers and feet
a pounding or fluttering heart beat (heart palpitations)

People with hEDS or HSD may have other related conditions and further symptoms, including:

stress incontinence – when urine leaks out when your bladder is under pressure
hernias – where an internal part of the body, like an organ, pushes through a weakness in the muscle or surrounding tissue wall
in women, pelvic organ prolapse – where the organs inside the pelvis slip down from their normal position
varicose veins – swollen and enlarged veins, usually blue or dark purple
flat feet – where the inner part of your feet (the arch) is not raised off the ground when you stand
headaches
drooping eyelids
a tendency to bruise easily and develop stretch marks
thin or stretchy skin
"
Kaposi’s sarcoma,
Kidney cancer,"Most cases of kidney cancer don’t cause any symptoms in the early stages.
The most common symptoms of mid- to advanced-stage kidney cancer are:

blood in your urine (haematuria) – the amount of blood is usually high enough to change the colour of your urine to a reddish or dark brown colour
a persistent pain in your side, just below the ribs
a lump or swelling in the area of your kidneys (on either side of the body)

However, in around half of all cases, the cancer causes no symptoms and is only detected during a routine ultrasound scan.
Less common symptoms of kidney cancer include:

extreme tiredness (fatigue) or anaemia
unintentional weight loss
a high temperature of 38C (100.4F) or above
night sweats 
a general sense of feeling unwell
swelling of the veins in the testicles (in men)
loss of appetite
high blood pressure (hypertension)

Speak to your GP immediately if you have pain or a swelling or lump in your kidney area (on either side of your body, just below your ribcage).
You should also speak to your GP if you have blood in your urine. Although it’s highly unlikely to be caused by kidney cancer, it could be a symptom of a less serious condition that still requires treatment, such as a kidney stone or bladder stone."
Kidney infection,"The symptoms of a kidney infection usually develop quite quickly over a few hours or days.
Common symptoms include:

pain and discomfort in your side, lower back or around your genitals
high temperature (it may reach 39.5C or 103.1F)
shivering or chills
feeling very weak or tired
loss of appetite
feeling sick or being sick 
diarrhoea

You may have other symptoms if you also have cystitis or urethritis (an infection of the urethra). These additional symptoms may include:

pain or a burning sensation during urination
need to urinate frequently or urgently
feeling that you’re unable to urinate fully
blood in your urine
cloudy or foul smelling urine
pain in your lower abdomen

Children with a kidney infection may also have additional symptoms, such as:

a lack of energy
irritability
poor feeding and/or vomiting
not growing at the expected rate
abdominal pain
jaundice (yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes)
blood in the urine
unpleasant smelling urine
bedwetting

Contact your GP if you have a high temperature, persistent pain, or if you notice a change to your usual pattern of urination. Contact your GP immediately if you think your child may have a kidney infection.
If you have blood in your urine, you should always see your GP so the cause can be investigated.
Kidney infections require prompt treatment with antibiotics to help relieve symptoms and prevent complications developing.
Your GP can carry out some simple tests to help diagnose a kidney infection.
See diagnosing kidney infections for more information"
Kidney stones,"Very small kidney stones are unlikely to cause many symptoms. It may even go undetected and pass out painlessly when you urinate.
Symptoms usually occur if the kidney stone:

gets stuck in your kidney
starts to travel down the ureter (the tube that attaches each kidney to the bladder) – the ureter is narrow and kidney stones can cause pain as they try to pass through
causes an infection

In these cases, the symptoms of kidney stones can include:

a persistent ache in the lower back, which is sometimes also felt in the groin – men may have pain in their testicles and scrotum
periods of intense pain in the back or side of your abdomen, or occasionally in your groin, which may last for minutes or hours
feeling restless and unable to lie still
nausea (feeling sick)
needing to urinate more often than normal
pain when you urinate (dysuria)
blood in your urine (haematuria) – this may be caused by the stone scratching the kidney or ureter

A kidney stone that blocks the ureter can lead to a kidney infection. This is because waste products are unable to pass the blockage, which may cause a build-up of bacteria.
The symptoms of a kidney infection are similar to symptoms of kidney stones, but may also include:

a high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or over
chills and shivering
feeling very weak or tired
diarrhoea
cloudy and bad-smelling urine

Read more about kidney infections."
Labyrinthitis,"The most common symptoms of labyrinthitis are:

vertigo (dizziness) – the sensation that you, or the environment around you, is moving
hearing loss (from mild to total loss of hearing)
a feeling of pressure inside your ear(s)
ringing or humming in your ear(s) (tinnitus)
feeling sick (nausea) or being sick
mild headaches

Certain things can make the dizziness worse, including:

colds or illness, or anything that makes you feel generally unwell
the dark
tiredness or jetlag
being on your period

Your GP may:

ask about your symptoms
check your medical history
carry out a physical examination – you may be asked to move your head or body and they can check your ears for signs of inflammation and infection
test your hearing – labyrinthitis is more likely if you have hearing loss
check your eyes – if they’re flickering uncontrollably your balancing system may not be working properly

You’ll usually have already seen your GP about labyrinthitis symptoms and may have started some treatment. There are things you can also do during this time to help manage your symptoms at home.
If your symptoms are particularly severe, your GP may prescribe:

prochlorperazine – can help with dizziness and sickness
antiemetic – can help if you’re feeling sick and vomiting
corticosteroids – can help by reducing inflammation

A small number of people experience dizziness and vertigo for months or years. This is known as chronic labyrinthitis.
Chronic labyrinthitis requires a treatment called vestibular rehabilitation therapy (VRT). VRT is usually supervised by a physiotherapist. You can ask your GP to refer you or you can pay for private treatment. If you see a private physiotherapist, make sure they are fully qualified and a member of a recognised body. For example, the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy (CSP). Not all physiotherapists have training in VRT. You should tell them that you need this type of treatment before making an appointment.
Most cases of viral labyrinthitis occur in adults aged 30 to 60 years old. Viral labyrinthitis is quite common in adults. Other types of ear infections are usually more common in children.
Bacterial labyrinthitis is much less common. Younger children under 2 years old are more vulnerable to developing bacterial labyrinthitis.
Many people diagnosed with labyrinthitis only experience the balance symptoms without hearing loss.
This is known as vestibular neuronitis rather than labyrinthitis.
Both names are often used to describe the same diagnosis."
Lactose intolerance,
Laryngeal (larynx) cancer,"The main symptoms of laryngeal cancer include:

a change in your voice, such as sounding hoarse
pain when swallowing or difficulty swallowing 
a lump or swelling in your neck
a long-lasting cough
a persistent sore throat or earache
in severe cases, difficulty breathing

Some people may also experience bad breath, breathlessness, a high-pitched wheezing noise when breathing, unexplained weight loss, or fatigue (extreme tiredness).
You should speak to your GP if you have had any of the main symptoms for more than 3 weeks.
These symptoms are often caused by less serious conditions, such as laryngitis, but it’s a good idea to get them checked out.
If necessary, your GP can refer you to a hospital specialist for further tests to confirm or rule out cancer.
Read more about diagnosing laryngeal cancer.
It’s not clear exactly what causes laryngeal cancer, but your risk of getting the condition is increased by:

smoking tobacco
regularly drinking large amounts of alcohol
having a family history of head and neck cancer
having an unhealthy diet
exposure to certain chemicals and substances, such as asbestos and coal dust

By adopting a healthy lifestyle, including avoiding alcohol and tobacco, you can significantly reduce your chances of developing laryngeal cancer.
Read more about the causes of laryngeal cancer and preventing laryngeal cancer.
The main treatments for laryngeal cancer are radiotherapy, surgery and chemotherapy.
Radiotherapy or surgery to remove the cancerous cells from the larynx can often cure laryngeal cancer if it’s diagnosed early.
If the cancer is advanced, a combination of surgery to remove part or all of the larynx, radiotherapy and chemotherapy can be used.
If you have surgery to remove your larynx, you’ll no longer be able to speak or breathe in the usual way. Instead, you will breathe through a permanent hole in your neck (stoma) and you will need additional treatment to help restore your voice.
This may include an implant in your throat, or an electrical device you hold against your throat to produce sound.
Read more about treating laryngeal cancer and recovering from laryngeal cancer surgery."
Laryngitis,"Symptoms of laryngitis can begin suddenly and usually get worse over a period of 2 to 3 days.
Common symptoms of laryngitis include:

hoarseness
difficulty speaking
sore throat
mild fever
irritating cough
a constant need to clear your throat

The hoarse voice and speaking difficulties usually get worse each day you’re ill. They may last for up to a week after the other symptoms have gone.
In a few cases, the larynx can swell and cause breathing difficulties. This isn’t common in adults but can happen in young children who have smaller, narrower windpipes.
Laryngitis is often linked to another illness. For example, a cold, flu, throat infection or tonsillitis. So you might also have other symptoms such as:

a headache
swollen glands
runny nose
pain when swallowing
feeling tired and achy

If you see your GP, they’ll discuss the possible causes with you and may refer you for tests or to a specialist in hospital.
In some cases, it may be possible to treat the underlying cause of laryngitis. For example, if the symptoms are caused by an allergic reaction, you may be able to:

avoid the thing you’re allergic to
take medication to help control your allergy

In most cases, laryngitis is caused by either:

a viral infection – such as a cold or flu
irritation to your larynx – for example by straining your voice or reflux

In these cases, most of the symptoms usually pass within a week. This is known as acute laryngitis.
Laryngitis can occasionally last much longer. This is known as chronic laryngitis. Chronic laryngitis can be caused by:

smoking
alcohol misuse
reflux

As laryngitis is often caused by a common viral infection, such as a cold or flu, it’s not always possible to prevent it.
There are things you can reduce your risk of developing the condition."
Leg cramps,"A leg cramp is an episode of sudden pain in the muscles of the leg. It’s caused by an involuntary contracting (shortening) of the leg muscle.
Cramps usually occur in the calf muscles, although they can affect any part of your leg. This includes your feet and thighs. Cramps can last from a few seconds up to 10 minutes. Thigh muscle cramps tend to last the longest.
During a cramping episode, the affected muscles will become tight and painful and the feet and toes will be stiff.
After the cramping has passed, you may have pain and tenderness in your leg for several hours.
Cramps often happen during the night when you’re sleeping.
Leg cramps might be a sign of a more serious health condition.
Your GP will ask about your symptoms and examine your legs and feet. They may also ask if you have other symptoms, like numbness or swelling. This may be a sign that you have secondary leg cramps caused by an underlying condition.
In this case, you may need further tests, like blood tests and urine tests, to rule out other conditions."
Lichen planus,"The symptoms of lichen planus vary, depending on which area of the body is affected.
Areas of the body most commonly affected by the condition include the:

skin
mouth
penis
vulva (external female sex organs) and vagina

The symptoms of lichen planus of the skin are:

purple-red coloured bumps (papules) that are slightly raised, shiny and have a flat top. The papules usually measure 3-5mm in diameter and may also have irregular white streaks (Wickham’s striae)
thicker scaly patches can appear, usually around the ankles – this is known as hypertrophic lichen planus
itchy skin

Lichen planus of the skin often affects the wrists, ankles and lower back, although other parts of the body can also be affected.
Thickened (hypertrophic) lichen planus affects the shins, and ring-shaped lichen planus affects creases in the skin, such as the armpits.
After the papules have cleared, the affected area of skin can sometimes become discoloured.
The symptoms of oral lichen planus are:

a white pattern on the tongue and inner cheeks
red and white patches in the mouth
burning and discomfort in the mouth while eating or drinking
painful red gums

Mild cases of oral lichen planus don’t usually cause any pain or discomfort.
The symptoms of lichen planus of the penis are:

purple or white ring-shaped patches on the tip of the penis (glans)
bumps (papules) that are flat-topped and shiny
a non-itchy rash

The symptoms of lichen planus of the vulva and vagina include:

soreness, burning and rawness around the vulva
the vulva may be covered in white streaks and be a red, pink or pale white colour
if the vagina is affected, sexual intercourse can be painful
if the outer layers of skin break down, moist, red patches can form
scar tissue can form, which distorts the shape of the vagina
a sticky yellow or green discharge, which may be bloodstained
the opening of the vagina can become narrowed

Lichen planus can sometimes affect other areas, including:

the nails – which can become thinner, ridged and grooved, or they may become darker, thicker or raised; they may sometimes shed or stop growing
the scalp – red patches can appear around clusters of hair; in some cases, permanent hair loss can occur
"
Lipoedema,"People with lipoedema usually have a small waist, but large hips and thighs. Their upper body and lower body can be completely different sizes. This makes it difficult to shop for clothes that fit right.
Symptoms can include:

enlargement of your legs, and in some cases arms, but usually not your feet or hands
pain, discomfort, heaviness or tenderness affected areas
affected areas of your body can bruise easily, sometimes for no obvious reason
dimpled legs with a lumpy texture, fat may bulge at the knees
swelling that gets worse in the afternoon, evening, after activity or in hot weather
spider veins or varicose veins on your legs
difficulty walking due to changes in your leg shape, heavy legs, or ‘flat-feet’

Lipoedema can be linked to mental health problems, for example depression, anxiety and disordered eating.
Speak to your doctor if you are experiencing any of these symptoms. They’ll be able to give you help and advice on how to manage your symptoms.
Other health conditions, like lymphoedema, can cause large or swollen legs. Sometimes people with lipoedema can also develop this condition."
Liver cancer,
Liver disease,
Liver tumours,
Long-term effects of COVID-19,
Loss of libido,
Low blood pressure (hypotension),"On its own, low blood pressure (hypotension) does not always cause symptoms. If you have low blood pressure and you do not have any symptoms, you do not require treatment.
However, low blood pressure can sometimes mean that there is not enough blood flowing to your brain and other vital organs. As a result, you may experience some of the following symptoms:

dizziness 
fainting (a sudden, temporary loss of consciousness)  
light-headedness 
blurred vision 
palpitations (a rapid or irregular heartbeat)
confusion 
nausea (feeling like you are going to be sick)
general weakness

If you experience the symptoms of hypotension after changing positions (for example, standing up), it is known as postural – or orthostatic – hypotension. If you experience these symptoms after eating, it is known as postprandial hypotension.
Postural or orthostatic hypotension occurs when your blood pressure falls after a sudden movement. For example, you may feel dizzy or faint after changing posture, such as sitting up from a lying position, or standing up from a sitting position. This may cause you to lose your balance and fall over. You may also feel light-headed, have blurred vision, or lose consciousness.
The symptoms of postural or orthostatic hypotension should only last a few minutes as your blood pressure adjusts to your new position. This type of low blood pressure tends to affect people more as they get older when it can lead to more frequent falls. Similar symptoms may also occur after exercise.
Your blood pressure can sometimes decrease (fall) after eating, causing dizziness, light-headedness, fainting and falls. This condition, known as postprandial hypotension, tends to occur more often in older people, particularly in those who have high blood pressure, or a condition such as Parkinson’s disease, or diabetes.
After a meal, your intestines need a large amount of blood for digestion. Your heart rate increases and the blood vessels in other parts of your body constrict (narrow) to help maintain blood pressure. If your heart rate does not increase enough, or if your blood vessels do not constrict enough to maintain blood pressure, your blood pressure will fall. This can then cause symptoms."
Lumbar stenosis," Symptoms like aching, cramping, tingling, heaviness and occasional weakness in the legs are usually brought on by walking or standing. They can be eased by sitting or leaning forward.
Patients with lumbar stenosis can also have back pain. However, low back pain with no leg symptoms is usually not thought to be caused by stenosis.  
Lumbar stenosis is a long term condition, and symptoms are often variable from day to day.  Many patients have found that managing their symptoms can help improve their quality of life. 
In order for lumbar stenosis to be diagnosed you’ll need an assessment from a healthcare professional.
They’ll ask you questions about your back issue and then carry out a physical examination. This may include checking your range of movement and strength.
You may sometimes need to have a further examination to rule out other possible health conditions.
As we get older, aging in the spine can cause narrowing and a reduction of space for the spinal nerves leading to irritation. Even then, nerves are resilient and can learn how to cope with this narrower tunnel.  
Clinicians may call the condition “central stenosis” or “foraminal stenosis”, depending on where the changes in your spine have happened.  
Rarely spinal stenosis can cause a condition called Cauda Equina Syndrome to develop. This is a rare but serious back condition which can lead to permanent damage or disability. If you develop this condition you’ll need to be seen by an emergency specialist spinal team.
Many people can cope with their stenosis with a combination of time, modifying activity, and pacing themselves to allow the nerves to adapt.
If your symptoms are relieved by bending or leaning forward, many people find it helpful to have regular breaks when walking like taking a seat or leaning against a wall. If you’re struggling with your walking it may be helpful to talk to a healthcare professional about a walking aid or support.
Pain medication, staying active, and gentle exercise may also help.
The following can help to reduce the pain:

pain medication – this can help you move more comfortably, which can help your recovery
heat or ice packs

More about taking painkillers.
In some cases, surgery may be an option if symptoms are not improving and all other treatment options have been tried. The operation, called spinal decompression, involves reducing the pressure on the nerves affected by stenosis.
A back problem can sometimes mean you need to take some time off work to help recovery. How long you’re off will depend on the nature of your condition and your role at work.
You do not need to be symptom free before you consider returning to work. Continuing to go to work, or returning to work as soon as is possible for you, will help your recovery. Gradually getting back to your normal daily activities can help to build up your strength and stamina levels.
Following this advice, you should see gradual improvements over time.
You should see the biggest change in your symptoms within the first couple of weeks. Most problems should have improved within 6 weeks.
If your back problem hasn’t improved within 6 weeks of following this advice, or if your symptoms get worse at any time, talk to a healthcare professional about your symptoms.

Lung cancer,"Symptoms of lung cancer develop as the condition progresses and there are usually no signs or symptoms in the early stages.
The main symptoms of lung cancer are:

a cough that doesn’t go away after 2 or 3 weeks
a long-standing cough that gets worse
persistent chest infections
coughing up blood
an ache or pain when breathing or coughing
persistent breathlessness
persistent tiredness or lack of energy
loss of appetite or unexplained weight loss

Less common symptoms of lung cancer include:

changes in the appearance of your fingers, such as becoming more curved or their ends becoming larger (this is known as finger clubbing)
a high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above 
difficulty swallowing or pain when swallowing
wheezing
a hoarse voice 
swelling of your face or neck
persistent chest or shoulder pain

If you have any of these, you should speak to your GP.

Lupus,
Lyme disease,
Lymphoedema,"The main symptom of lymphoedema is swelling in all or part of a limb or another part of the body, which can cause problems fitting into clothes, or jewellery and watches starting to feel tight.
At first, the swelling may come and go. It may get worse during the day and then go down overnight. Without treatment, it will usually become more severe and persistent.
Other symptoms in an affected body part can include:

an aching, heavy feeling
difficulty with movement
repeated skin infections
the skin becoming hard and tight
folds developing in the skin
wart-like growths developing on the skin
a leakage of fluid through the skin

When these symptoms start depends on what is causing the condition.
If lymphoedema is caused by abnormal development of the lymphatic system (a network of channels and glands distributed throughout the body that remove unwanted bacteria and particles from the body), the symptoms can develop at any age, but most commonly start during infancy, adolescence or early adulthood.
In these cases, the swelling may start on one side of the body to begin with, although the other side will usually become swollen as well over time – particularly the lower leg.
If lymphoedema is caused by damage to the lymphatic system, the symptoms can develop at any time. For example, if your lymphatic system is damaged due to treatment for breast cancer, lymphoedema may not develop for several months or even years.
Read more about the causes of lymphoedema
If you are at risk of developing lymphoedema because you have had treatment for cancer, you may be offered an assessment for the condition as part of your treatment aftercare plan. Speak to your consultant or specialist nurse if you have any concerns.
If you think you may have lymphoedema, but not as a result of treatment for cancer, see your GP.

Lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV),"Most people with LGV don’t notice any symptoms and don’t know they have it. So it’s important to get tested if you think you’re infected.
If you do develop symptoms, you may experience:

swollen lymph glands in the groin (in one or both sides)
an ulcer or sore on the penis, vagina or around the anus

You may notice some anal symptoms such as:

blood or pus from the anus on underwear or toilet paper
pain in the anal area when pooing or having receptive anal sex
constipation, painful straining or diarrhoea when trying to poo
a feeling of incomplete emptying after pooing

If you think you might have LGV, get tested for free by:

booking an appointment at your local sexual health service
contacting your GP practice for an appointment

If you test positive for chlamydia, and your symptoms suggest that you might have LGV, the lab will do a further test for LGV.
The test for LGV is simple, painless and very reliable. It involves sending a sample from the area of the body thought to be infected to a lab for analysis. This can take up to 3 weeks.
The 2 main ways the sample can be collected are:

using a swab – a small cotton bud is gently wiped over the area that might be infected, such as inside the vagina, throat, or inside the anus
urine sample – this should ideally be done at least 1 or 2 hours after you last peed

Your partner (s) for the past 3 months should also be tested for LGV.
Antibiotics will treat the LGV infection.
The result of the LGV test can take 3 weeks to come back, so your doctor may advise you to start treatment before the final result is available.
If left untreated, LGV can cause scarring and swelling of the skin. It can also cause permanent swelling of the genitals. Rectal infection can also cause swelling and scarring resulting in the risk of long-term bowel complications. Rarely the infection may spread via the bloodstream causing inflammation of the joints or liver.
To avoid passing LGV on to your partner(s) you should avoid having sex until both you and your partner have finished your treatment.
You can get LGV by having unprotected vaginal, anal or oral sex (sex without a condom).
Your risk of getting LGV may be increased by:

chemsex
having group sex
fisting
sharing sex toys that aren’t washed or covered with a new condom each time they’re used

The best way to reduce your risk of STIs is to practice safer sex. This means using a condom for vaginal, anal and oral sex.
If you have been diagnosed with LGV you should get tested for all STIs including:

gonorrhoea
syphilis
HIV
"
Malaria,"It’s important to be aware of the symptoms of malaria if you’re travelling to areas where there’s a high risk of the disease. This means that you can get medical attention quickly.
Symptoms are similar to those of flu and usually appear 6 to 30 days after the mosquito bite, but it can sometimes take up to a year for symptoms to start.
The initial symptoms of malaria include:

a high temperature (fever)
headache
sweats
chills
muscle aches or pains
vomiting and or diarrhoea

These symptoms can start mild and may be difficult to identify as malaria.
Malaria is a serious illness that can get worse very quickly. It can be fatal if not treated quickly.
The effects of malaria are usually more severe in:

babies
young children
pregnant women
older people

Malaria is caused by the Plasmodium parasite. The parasite is spread to humans through the bites of infected mosquitoes.
There are 5 different types of Plasmodium parasite that cause malaria in humans. They are found in different parts of the world (but do overlap in certain areas) and vary in terms of how severe the infection can be.
All malaria infections cause the same symptoms and require immediate medical attention. It’s not possible to find out which type of malaria you have from symptoms alone.
The Plasmodium parasite is spread by mosquitoes. These are known as ‘night-biting’ mosquitoes because they most commonly bite between sunset and sunrise.
When a mosquito bites a person already infected with malaria, it becomes infected and spreads the parasite to the next person it bites. Malaria can’t be spread directly from person to person.
When an infected mosquito bites, the parasite enters the blood and travels to the liver. In the liver, it develops for days to weeks before re-entering the blood. This is the point where symptoms develop and urgent treatment is required.
Although it is very rare, malaria can also be spread from a person with the infection through blood transfusions and sharing needles.
Malaria is found in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. It is not found in the UK or Europe.
The fitfortravel website has more information about the risk of malaria in individual countries.
Malaria is a serious illness that can be fatal if not diagnosed and treated quickly. Severe complications of malaria can occur within hours or days of the first symptoms. This means it is important to seek urgent medical help as soon as possible.
The destruction of red blood cells by the malaria parasite can cause severe anaemia.
Anaemia is a condition where the red blood cells are unable to carry enough oxygen to the body’s muscles and organs. This can leave you feeling drowsy, weak and faint.
In rare cases, malaria can affect the brain. This is known as cerebral malaria which can cause your brain to swell, sometimes leading to permanent brain damage. It can also cause fits (seizures) or coma.
Other complications that can arise as a result of severe malaria include:

liver failure and jaundice – yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes
shock – a sudden drop in blood pressure
pulmonary oedema – a build-up of fluid in the lungs
acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
abnormally low blood sugar – hypoglycaemia
kidney failure
swelling and rupturing of the spleen
dehydration

If you get malaria while pregnant, you and your baby have an increased risk of developing serious complications like:

premature birth – birth before 37 weeks of pregnancy
low birth weight
restricted growth of the baby in the womb
stillbirth
miscarriage
death of the mother

Pregnant women are advised to avoid travelling to regions with a risk of malaria."
Malignant brain tumour (cancerous),"Different areas of the brain control different functions, so the symptoms caused by a brain tumour will depend on where the tumour is located. For example, a tumour affecting:

the frontal lobe may cause changes in personality, weakness in one side of the body and loss of smell
the temporal lobe may cause forgetfulness, language problems (aphasia) and seizures
the parietal lobe may cause aphasia and numbness or weakness in one side of the body
the occipital lobe may cause loss of vision on one side
the cerebellum may cause a loss of co-ordination, flickering of the eyes, vomiting and a stiff neck
the brain stem may cause unsteadiness and difficulty walking, facial weakness, double vision, and difficulty speaking (dysarthria) and swallowing (dysphagia)

It’s important to speak to a doctor if you develop persistent and worrying symptoms that may be caused by a brain tumour. While it’s unlikely that you have a tumour, it’s best to be sure by getting a proper diagnosis.
If your GP is unable to identify a more likely cause of your symptoms, they may refer you to a neurologist for further assessment and tests, such as a brain scan.

Malnutrition,
Managing genital symptoms,
Measles,"The first symptoms of measles develop around 10 days after you’re infected. These can include:

cold-like symptoms, such as a runny nose, sneezing, and a cough
sore, red eyes that may be sensitive to light
watery eyes
swollen eyes
a high temperature (fever), which may reach around 40°C (104°F)
small greyish-white spots in the mouth
aches and pains
loss of appetite
tiredness, irritability and a general lack of energy

The measles rash appears around 2 to 4 days after the initial symptoms and normally fades after about a week. The rash:

is made up of small red-brown, flat or slightly raised spots that may join together into larger blotchy patches
usually first appears on the head or neck, before spreading outwards to the rest of the body
is slightly itchy for some people

You should phone your GP first before visiting. They can make arrangements to reduce the risk of spreading the infection to others.
Measles can be unpleasant, but will usually pass in about 7 to 10 days without causing any further problems.
Once you’ve had measles, your body builds up resistance (immunity) to the virus. It’s highly unlikely you’ll get it again.
However, measles can lead to serious and potentially life-threatening complications in some people. These include infections of the lungs (pneumonia) and brain (encephalitis).
The measles virus is contained in tiny droplets that come out of the nose and mouth when an infected person coughs or sneezes.
You can easily catch measles by breathing in these droplets. Or, if the droplets have settled on a surface, by touching the surface and then placing your hands near your nose or mouth. The virus can survive on surfaces for a few hours.
People with measles are infectious from when the symptoms develop until about 4 days after the rash first appears.
If you have measles:

stay off school or work for at least 4 days from when the rash first appears
regularly wash your hands with soap
use and dispose of tissues when you sneeze
avoid close contact with anyone who isn’t fully vaccinated

Measles can be prevented by having the MMR vaccine.
This is given in 2 doses as part of the NHS childhood vaccination programme.
You can be vaccinated at any age if you haven’t been fully vaccinated before. 
If the MMR vaccine isn’t suitable for you, a treatment called human normal immunoglobulin (HNIG) can be used if you’re at immediate risk of catching measles.
There are things you can do to help relieve your symptoms.
In severe cases, especially if there are complications, you or your child may need to be admitted to hospital for treatment."
Meningitis,"Symptoms of meningitis develop suddenly and can include:

a high temperature (fever) over 37.5C (99.5F)
being sick
a headache
a blotchy rash that doesn’t fade when a glass is rolled over it (this won’t always develop)
a stiff neck
a dislike of bright lights
drowsiness or unresponsiveness
seizures (fits)

These symptoms can appear in any order and some may not appear.
You should get medical advice as soon as possible if you’re concerned that you or your child could have meningitis.
Trust your instincts and don’t wait until a rash develops.
Phone 999 for an ambulance or go to your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department immediately if you think you or your child might be seriously ill.
Phone 111 or your GP practice for advice if you’re not sure if it’s anything serious or you think you may have been exposed to someone with meningitis.
Meningitis is usually caused by a bacterial or viral infection. Bacterial meningitis is rarer but more serious than viral meningitis.
Infections that cause meningitis can be spread through:

sneezing
coughing
kissing
sharing utensils, cutlery and toothbrushes

Meningitis is usually caught from people who carry these viruses or bacteria in their nose or throat but aren’t ill themselves.
It can also be caught from someone with meningitis, but this is less common.
Read more about the causes of meningitis
Vaccinations offer some protection against certain causes of meningitis.
These include the:

meningitis B vaccine – offered to babies aged 8 weeks, followed by a second dose at 16 weeks, and a booster at 1 year
6-in-1 vaccine – offered to babies at 8, 12 and 16 weeks of age
pneumococcal vaccine – offered to babies at 12 weeks and between 12 and 13 months old
meningitis C vaccine – offered at 12 weeks of age, 1 year
MMR vaccine – offered to babies at 1 year and a second dose at 3 years and 4 months
meningitis ACWY vaccine – offered to teenagers who are in S3 (around 14 years of age) at school. Young people who are in S4-S6 and missed the opportunity to get immunised last year, may also get the vaccine at school this year

Read more about the meningitis vaccinations
People with suspected meningitis will usually have tests in hospital to confirm the diagnosis and check whether the condition is the result of a viral or bacterial infection.
Bacterial meningitis usually needs to be treated in hospital for at least a week. Treatments include:

antibiotics given directly into a vein
fluids given directly into a vein
oxygen through a face mask

Viral meningitis tends to get better on its own within 7 to 10 days and can often be treated at home. Getting plenty of rest and taking painkillers and anti-sickness medication can help relieve the symptoms in the meantime.
Read more about how meningitis is treated
Viral meningitis will usually get better on its own and rarely causes any long-term problems.
Most people with bacterial meningitis who are treated quickly will also make a full recovery, although some are left with serious, long-term problems. These can include:

hearing loss or vision loss, which may be partial or total
problems with memory and concentration
recurrent seizures (epilepsy)
co-ordination, movement and balance problems
loss of limbs – amputation of affected limbs is sometimes necessary

Overall, it’s estimated that up to 1 in every 10 cases of bacterial meningitis is fatal.

Meniere’s disease,"The symptoms and severity of Ménière’s disease vary widely from person to person.
The main symptoms of Ménière’s disease are:

vertigo – the feeling that you, or the environment around you, is moving or spinning
tinnitus – hearing sounds from inside your body, rather than from an outside source
hearing loss, with a particular difficulty hearing deep or low sounds
a feeling of pressure or fullness deep inside the ear
feeling or being sick

Symptoms typically last around 2 to 3 hours. But it can take a day or two for the symptoms to disappear completely.
These symptoms usually only affect one ear at first, but both ears may become affected over time.
Other symptoms include:

sensitivity to sound (hyperacusis)
distorted sound

There’s no single test for Ménière’s disease. It can be difficult to distinguish from other conditions with similar symptoms.
Your GP will ask you to describe your symptoms to find out if there’s a pattern.
For Ménière’s disease to be diagnosed, you’ll have had:

at least 2 episodes of vertigo lasting 20 minutes or more within a single Ménière’s disease attack
tests that confirm that hearing loss is caused by damage to the sensitive hair cells inside the cochlea (the coiled tube in the inner ear)
tinnitus or a feeling of pressure in your ear

Your GP may also carry out a physical examination to rule out other possible causes of your symptoms.
If needed, your GP can refer you to an ear nose and throat (ENT) specialist for further tests.
Ménière’s disease cannot be cured, but treatment can usually help your symptoms.
Possible treatments include:

medicines to treat the symptoms and prevent attacks
changes to your eating habits, such as a low-salt diet
treatment for tinnitus
treatment for hearing loss
balance training (vestibular rehabilitation)
relaxation techniques
surgery – only rarely, in more severe cases

Some people with Ménière’s disease also find that it affects their mental health.
Speak to your GP practice if you’re finding it difficult to cope with the effect Ménière’s disease is having on your life. There are also support groups that can help you.
If you have vertigo, there are some safety issues to consider. For example:

you should tell your employer if your job involves operating machinery or climbing ladders
you may have a higher chance of falling – read about preventing falls for advice on reducing your risk

If you drive, you must tell the DVLA about your vertigo.
Get more information on driving with vertigo on GOV.UK
The exact cause of Ménière’s disease is unknown. It’s thought to be caused by a problem with pressure deep inside the ear.
Factors that can increase your risk of developing Ménière’s disease include:

a family history of the condition
a chemical imbalance in the fluid in your inner ear
"
Menopause,
Mesothelioma,"The symptoms of mesothelioma tend to develop gradually over time. They typically don’t appear until several decades after exposure to asbestos.
Symptoms of mesothelioma in the lining of the lungs include:

chest pain
shortness of breath
fatigue (extreme tiredness)
a high temperature (fever) and sweating, particularly at night
a persistent cough
loss of appetite and unexplained weight loss
clubbed (swollen) fingertips

Symptoms of mesothelioma in the lining of the tummy include:

tummy pain or swelling
feeling or being sick
loss of appetite and unexplained weight loss
diarrhoea or constipation

Speak to your GP if you have any persistent or worrying symptoms. Tell them about any exposure to asbestos you may have had in the past.
Mesothelioma is almost always caused by exposure to asbestos, a group of minerals made of microscopic fibres that used to be widely used in construction.
These tiny fibres can easily get in the lungs, where they get stuck, damaging the lungs over time. It usually takes a while for this to cause any obvious problems, with mesothelioma typically developing more than 20 years after exposure to asbestos.
The use of asbestos was completely banned in 1999, so the risk of exposure is much lower nowadays. However, materials containing asbestos are still found in many older buildings.
Read more about asbestos and people at risk of exposure and avoiding exposure to asbestos.
If your GP suspects mesothelioma, they will refer you to a hospital specialist for some tests.
A number of different tests may need to be carried out, including:

an X-ray of your chest or tummy
a computerised tomography (CT) scan – a number of X-ray images are taken to create a detailed image of the inside of the body
fluid drainage – if there’s a build-up of fluid around the lungs or in the tummy, a sample may be removed using a needle inserted through the skin so the fluid can be analysed
a thoracoscopy or laparoscopy – the inside of your chest or tummy is examined with a long, thin camera that’s inserted through a small cut (incision) under sedation or anaesthetic; a sample of tissue (biopsy) may be removed so it can be analysed

These tests can help diagnose mesothelioma and show how far it has spread.
The best treatment for mesothelioma depends on several factors, including how far the cancer has spread and your general health.
As mesothelioma is often diagnosed at an advanced stage, treatment is usually focused on controlling the symptoms and prolonging life for as long as possible. This is known as palliative or supportive care.
Possible treatments include:

chemotherapy – this is the main treatment for mesothelioma and involves using medicine to help shrink the cancer
radiotherapy – this involves using high-energy radiation to kill cancer cells and it may be used to slow the cancer down and keep it under control
surgery – an operation to remove the cancerous area can be done if mesothelioma is detected at a very early stage, although it’s not clear whether surgery is helpful

You’ll also probably have treatment for your individual symptoms to help you feel as comfortable as possible. For example, regularly draining fluid from your chest may help your breathing and strong painkillers may help relieve your pain.
Sometimes, a procedure is carried out to stop the fluid coming back again by making the outside of the lungs stick to the inside of your chest (pleurodesis), or a tube is put in your chest to drain the fluid regularly at home. Your doctors should discuss these treatments with you."
Middle ear infection (otitis media),"The main symptoms of a middle ear infection include:

earache
a high temperature (fever)
being sick
a lack of energy
slight hearing loss – if the middle ear becomes filled with fluid

In some cases, a hole may develop in the eardrum (perforated eardrum) and pus may run out of the ear. The earache, which is caused by the build-up of fluid stretching the eardrum, then resolves.
Young children and babies with an ear infection may also:

rub or pull their ear
not react to some sounds
be irritable or restless
be off their food
keep losing their balance

Most ear infections get better on their own within 3 to 5 days and do not need any specific treatment.
If needed, paracetamol or ibuprofen can be used to relieve pain and a high temperature. Always read the leaflet that comes with your medicine before taking it. Follow the recommended dosage instructions. If you’re not sure which treatments are suitable for you or your child, speak to a pharmacist for advice.
Placing a warm cloth over the affected ear may also help relieve pain.
Antibiotics are not usually used to treat middle ear infections.
Most middle ear infections occur when an infection, such as a cold, leads to a build-up of mucus in the middle ear. This causes the Eustachian tube (a thin tube that runs from the middle ear to the back of the nose) to become swollen or blocked. The mucus can’t drain away properly, making it easier for an infection to spread into the middle ear.
An enlarged adenoid (soft tissue at the back of the throat) can also block the Eustachian tube. The adenoid can be removed if it often causes ear infections.
Middle ear infections are more common in younger children because:

the Eustachian tube is smaller in children than in adults
a child’s adenoids are relatively larger than an adults

Certain conditions can also increase the risk of middle ear infections, including:

having a cleft palate
having Down’s syndrome

It’s not possible to prevent middle ear infections. There are some things you can do that may reduce your child’s risk of developing one.
Children who go to nursery or school can pick up infections from other children who are unwell.
Complications of middle ear infections are fairly rare, but can be serious.
Most complications are the result of the infection spreading to another part of the ear or head. Rarely, infections can leave a perforation or hole in the eardrum.
If complications do develop, they often need to be treated immediately with antibiotics in hospital."
Migraine,"About 1 in 3 people with migraine have temporary warning symptoms, known as aura, before a migraine. These include:

visual problems – like seeing flashing lights, zig-zag patterns or blind spots
numbness or a tingling sensation like pins and needles – which usually starts in one hand and moves up your arm before affecting your face, lips and tongue
difficulty speaking

Sometimes, you might also experience:

feeling dizzy or off balance
loss of consciousness – although this is unusual

Aura symptoms typically develop over the course of about 5 minutes and last for up to an hour. The aura might start before the headache or you might experience it at the same time as a headache. Some people may experience aura followed by only a mild headache or no headache at all."
Miscarriage,"You might be having a late miscarriage if:

you’re bleeding from your vagina – this can be heavy and you might have blood clots
you’ve strong, cramping pains

Always get medical help if:

you’re bleeding
your baby’s movements have changed or you haven’t felt any movements for a while.
your waters break and your baby’s born very quickly

Contact your midwife or local maternity unit if you’re registered with them. If you’re not registered, contact your GP or phone the NHS 24 111 service.
If you’re later on in pregnancy:

you may be asked to go to the maternity ward
you’ll have some tests and usually an ultrasound scan
you’re likely to go through labour in hospital and might have your labour induced

While you deliver your baby you’re likely to have heavier bleeding and labour-like pains.
If you’re having a miscarriage, your doctor or midwife will:

talk to you about what will happen next
help you, and your partner if you have one, decide what you’d like to do

You may have many difficult decisions to make at this time and will have overwhelming emotions. Take your time. Your midwife or doctor can help, and there are many organisations that can support you, your baby’s father and your family.
Get support from SANDS
Get support from SiMBA
Depending on your circumstances and stage of pregnancy, your midwife or doctor may ask if you’d like to see or hold your baby.
Some parents decide they don’t want to see their baby, and others choose not to for faith or cultural reasons. This is a decision only you can make. It can be very hard when you’re feeling overwhelmed. Whatever you decide is okay.
If you’re worried about what your baby looks like, your midwife or doctor can describe them to help you decide.
You’ll probably have some bleeding for a week or two. If you continue to have symptoms after your miscarriage, it may mean that some of the pregnancy tissue’s still in your womb.
Some women may need medicine or a short operation to treat this.
If you’re worried about seeking treatment, maybe a friend can come with you. Having support’s really important at this difficult time.
Many women will want to take time off work after having a miscarriage.
If you have a miscarriage before the end of the 24th week, you’re entitled to:

take sick leave
any sick pay you’d normally qualify for

If you lose your baby after the end of the 24th week, you’re entitled to:

take maternity leave
any maternity pay you qualify for

Speak to your employer about which choices may be right for you and your family.
Working Families has more about your rights at work after a miscarriage
Most women go on to have a successful pregnancy and a healthy baby after a miscarriage. But unfortunately, some women have repeated miscarriages.
If you’ve had:

1 or 2 miscarriages – you’re not more likely than anyone else to have another one
3 or more miscarriages – your GP can refer you to a specialist to see whether there’s a specific cause
"
Motor neurone disease (MND),"The symptoms of MND start gradually over weeks and months. They tend to appear on one side of the body first and get progressively worse.
There are usually 3 stages of symptoms.
Sometimes the early symptoms are mistaken for similar conditions that also affect the nervous system.
As MND becomes more advanced, more parts and functions of the body are affected. This can make you more likely to experience infections, like chest infections, which can cause your condition to get worse quicker.
As MND progresses to its final phase, you might experience:

increasing body paralysis, which means you’ll need help with most daily activities
significant shortness of breath

Eventually, non-invasive breathing assistance won’t be enough to make up for the loss of normal lung function. At this stage, more medication can help to reduce symptoms of breathlessness and anxiety related to it. Most people with MND become increasingly drowsy before falling into a deep sleep, where they usually die peacefully.
Some people with MND have other symptoms that aren’t directly caused by the condition, but are related to the stress of living with it. These might include depression, insomnia and anxiety."
Mouth cancer,"Mouth cancer can develop on most parts of the mouth, including the lips, gums and occasionally, the throat.
The most common symptoms of mouth cancer include:

red or white patches in the mouth or throat
a lump
ulcers

Other symptoms may include:

persistent pain in the mouth
pain or difficulty when swallowing (dysphagia)
changes in your voice, or speech problems
swollen lymph nodes (glands) in your neck
unexplained weight loss
bleeding or numbness in the mouth
a tooth, or teeth, that becomes loose for no obvious reason
difficulty moving your jaw

Many of these symptoms can be caused by less serious conditions, such as minor infections.
But it’s strongly recommended that you visit your GP if any of these symptoms have lasted for more than 3 weeks. It’s especially important to seek medical advice if you’re a heavy drinker or smoker.
Mouth cancer tends not to cause any noticeable symptoms during the initial stages of the disease.
This is why it’s important to have regular dental check-ups, particularly if you are a smoker, a heavy drinker or a betel chewer, because a dentist may often be able to detect the condition during an examination.
You should have a dental check-up at least every year. However, more frequent check-ups may be recommended if you have a history of tooth decay or gum disease."
Mouth ulcer,
Multiple myeloma,"In the early stages, multiple myeloma may not cause any symptoms or complications, and may only be diagnosed after a routine blood or urine test.
However, it will eventually cause a wide range of problems.
Multiple myeloma can cause pain in affected bones, most often the back, ribs or hips. The pain is frequently a persistent dull ache, which may be made worse by movement.
Multiple myeloma can weaken the bones and make them more likely to break (fracture). The spine and ribs are most often affected.
Fractures of the spine can cause the sections of the spine to collapse, leading to pain and occasionally compression of the spinal cord (the main column of nerves running down the back).
Compression of the spinal cord can cause pins and needles, numbness and weakness in the legs and feet, and sometimes problems controlling your bladder and bowels.
Multiple myeloma can affect the production of blood cells in our bone marrow, which can lead to a lack of red blood cells (anaemia). This can also occur as a side effect of myeloma treatment.
If you have anaemia, you may feel very tired, weak and breathless.
People with multiple myeloma are particularly vulnerable to infection because the condition interferes with the immune system (the body’s natural defence against infection and illness).
You may find you get infections frequently and that they last for a long time.
A high level of calcium in the blood (hypercalcaemia) can develop in people with multiple myeloma because too much calcium is released from affected bones into the bloodstream.
Symptoms of hypercalcaemia can include extreme thirst, feeling sick, needing to urinate frequently, constipation, confusion and drowsiness.
Bruising and unusual bleeding (haemorrhage) – such as frequent nosebleeds, bleeding gums and heavy periods – sometimes occurs in multiple myeloma because the cancer cells in your bone marrow can stop blood clotting cells called platelets being made.
In some people, multiple myeloma can cause the blood to become thicker than normal. This is known as hyperviscosity, which can cause problems such as blurred vision, headaches, dizziness, bleeding from the gums or nose, and shortness of breath.
Kidney damage can occur in people with multiple myeloma for several reasons. Abnormal proteins produced by the cancer cells can damage the kidneys, as can other complications, such as hypercalcaemia. Some medications used to treat multiple myeloma can also cause kidney damage.
Eventually, the kidneys may stop working properly. This is known as kidney or renal impairment, or kidney or renal failure. Signs of kidney failure can include:

weight loss and poor appetite
swollen ankles, feet or hands
tiredness and a lack of energy
shortness of breath
itchy skin
feeling sick

You should speak to your GP if you have symptoms of multiple myeloma. While they’re unlikely to be caused by cancer, it’s best to be sure by getting a proper diagnosis.
You should seek immediate medical help if you have symptoms of spinal cord compression, hypercalcaemia or kidney failure, as these are medical emergencies that need to be investigated and treated as soon as possible.

Multiple sclerosis (MS),"Multiple sclerosis (MS) can cause a wide range of symptoms and can affect any part of the body. It affects everyone differently.
The symptoms are unpredictable. Some people’s symptoms develop and worsen over time, while for others, they come and go.
Periods when symptoms get worse are known as relapses. Periods when symptoms improve or disappear are known as remissions.
Some of the most common symptoms include:
MS is an autoimmune condition. This means your immune system mistakes part of your body for a foreign substance and attacks it.
In the case of MS, it attacks the myelin sheath in the brain and/or spinal cord. This is the layer that surrounds your nerves, protecting them and helping electrical signals travel from the brain to the rest of the body.
The attacks cause the myelin sheath to become inflamed in small patches (plaques or lesions). This can be seen on a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan.
These patches of inflammation can disrupt the messages travelling along the nerves. It can slow them down, jumble them, send them the wrong way, or stop them from getting through completely. This disruption leads to the symptoms and signs of MS.
When the inflammation goes away, it can leave behind scarring of the myelin sheath (sclerosis). These attacks, particularly if frequent and repeated, can lead to permanent damage.
Exactly why someone develops multiple sclerosis (MS) isn’t known. It’s not caused by anything you’ve done and it’s not clear if you can prevent it.
It’s likely to be partly caused by genes you inherit from your parents and partly by outside factors that may trigger the condition.
Some of the factors that might cause MS include:
More research will help us understand why MS occurs and whether it can be prevented or not.
It can be hard to tell if you have multiple sclerosis (MS) because some of the symptoms are like other conditions. You may need to rule out other possible causes of your symptoms first.
If your GP thinks you could have MS, you should see a neurologist (a specialist in conditions of the nervous system) for a specialist assessment.
Some of the tests you may need to confirm MS are:

neurological examination
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan
lumbar puncture
blood test

Once you have a diagnosis of MS, your neurologist might be able to identify which type of MS you have – either relapsing remitting MS or primary progressive MS.
This will largely be based on:

the pattern of your symptoms – like whether you experience periods when your symptoms get worse (relapses) then improve (remissions), or whether they get steadily worse (progress)
the results of an MRI scan

It can take some time to find out which type of MS you have because the symptoms are so varied. It can take a few years to make an accurate diagnosis of progressive MS, as the condition usually worsens slowly.
Although there isn’t a cure for MS, there are medicines that can help to reduce the number and severity of relapses in some people. These are called disease-modifying therapies or disease modifying drugs.
These reduce the amount of damage and scarring to the myelin sheath (layer surrounding your nerves), associated with MS relapses.
These treatments reduce the chances of developing progressive symptoms of MS. They might also help to slow worsening disability in MS.
Disease-modifying therapies are not suitable for everyone with MS. They’re only prescribed to those with either:

relapsing remitting MS
secondary progressive MS who meet certain criteria, like the number of relapses they’ve had
primary progressive MS who meet certain criteria like new lesions found by an MRI scan

People without relapses are less likely to benefit from the treatments and could still experience side effects from them.
Sometimes an infection can cause a flare up of symptoms rather than a relapse, so your nurse or GP will check for other possible causes.
Treatment for a relapse might involve a five-day course of steroid tablets taken at home.
Steroids can help speed up your recovery from a relapse. They don’t prevent further relapses or stop MS getting worse over time.
Steroids are only given for a short period of time to avoid possible steroid side effects. The side effects could include infection, mood disturbance, stomach ulceration, osteoporosis (weak bones), weight gain and diabetes.
Not using steroids more than three times a year (if possible) will help to reduce the risk of side effects.
There are different treatments available for MS symptoms.
Coming to terms with a long-term condition like MS can put a strain on you, your family and your friends. Be honest about how you feel and let your family and friends know what they can do to help.
If you have any questions, your MS nurse or GP can help and will let you know what support is available.
If you find it difficult to look after yourself, your local authority may be able to provide you with some help. Ask for a care and support needs assessment. For more information, read about assessing your care and support needs.
Being diagnosed with MS shouldn’t affect your ability to have children. Women with MS can have a normal pregnancy, deliver a healthy baby and breastfeed.
Some of the medications prescribed for MS aren’t suitable for taking during pregnancy or breastfeeding and might affect fertility in males and females. If you’re considering starting a family, discuss it with your healthcare team.
Having a baby doesn’t affect the long-term course of MS. Relapses can be less common in pregnancy, but they can be more common in the months after giving birth.
If you have to stop work or work part-time because of your MS, you may find it hard to cope financially. You might be able to get financial support.
If you have MS, you must tell the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) and inform your insurance company.
You might be able to continue driving, but you’ll be asked to complete a form providing more information about your condition. You’ll be asked for details of your doctors and specialists. The DVLA will use this to decide whether you’re fit to drive."
Multiple system atrophy (MSA),"Everyone with MSA will experience different symptoms. Symptoms often start between the ages of 50 and 60, but they can begin anytime from the age of 30.
You’re likely to experience muscle control or balance problems, like those of Parkinson’s disease or Ataxia. It’s a progressive disease which means symptoms will worsen over a period of time.
MSA can cause symptoms including:

bladder problems like a constant need to pee, loss of bladder control (urinary incontinence) or being unable to pee
low blood pressure when standing up which might cause dizziness or fainting (postural hypotension)
erection problems like erectile dysfunction
problems with co-ordination, balance and speech (cerebellar ataxia)
tremor, slowness and muscle stiffness
constipation

Someone with MSA might also have:

uncontrollable laughing or crying
problems with sleep like insomnia, restless legs or nightmares
noisy breathing
unintentional sighing
weak, quiet voice
shoulder and neck pain
problems controlling sweating
swallowing problems including difficult chewing and choking episodes
blurred vision
cold hands and feet
"
Mumps,"The symptoms of mumps usually develop 14 to 25 days after you’re infected.
Mumps causes painful swellings at the side of the face under the ears (the parotid glands). It gives a distinctive ‘hamster face’ appearance.
Other symptoms of mumps can include:

headaches
joint pain
feeling sick
dry mouth
mild stomach (abdominal) pain
feeling tired
loss of appetite
a high temperature (fever) of 38°C (100.4°F), or above

These may develop a few days before the swelling of the parotid glands.
Sometimes, mumps doesn’t cause any noticeable symptoms.
Mumps is not usually serious, but it has similar symptoms to more serious types of infection, such as glandular fever and tonsillitis.
You should phone your GP first before visiting. They can make arrangements to reduce the risk of spreading the infection to others.
Your GP can usually make a diagnosis after:

seeing and feeling the swelling
looking at the position of the tonsils in the mouth
checking your temperature to see if it’s higher than normal

If your GP suspects mumps, they should notify your local health protection team (HPT). 
Most cases of mumps occur in people aged between 17 and 34 who have not received 2 doses of the MMR vaccine.
Once you’ve had mumps, your body builds up resistance (immunity) to the virus. It’s highly unlikely you’ll get it again.
The mumps virus is contained in tiny droplets that come out of the nose and mouth when an infected person coughs or sneezes.
You can easily catch mumps by breathing in these droplets. Or, if the droplets have settled on a surface, by touching the surface and then placing your hands near your nose or mouth.
A person is most contagious a few days before the symptoms develop and for a few days afterwards.
If you have mumps:

stay off school or work for at least 5 days after your symptoms first develop
regularly wash your hands with soap
use and dispose of tissues when you sneeze
avoid close contact with anyone who isn’t fully vaccinated

Mumps can be prevented by having the MMR vaccine.
This is given in 2 doses as part of the NHS childhood vaccination programme.
You can be vaccinated at any age if you haven’t been fully vaccinated before. 
There are things you can do to help relieve your symptoms.
Mumps usually passes without causing serious damage to a person’s health. Serious complications are rare.
However, mumps can lead to viral meningitis if the virus moves into the outer layer of the brain. Other complications include swelling of the testicles in males or the ovaries in females if the affected person has gone through puberty.
About 1 in 20 cases of mumps lead to acute pancreatitis. This is usually mild, but you may be admitted to hospital so your body functions can be supported until your pancreas recovers.
About 1 in 20 people with mumps experience some temporary hearing loss, but permanent loss of hearing is rare."
Munchausen’s syndrome,"Warning signs that somebody may have Munchausen’s syndrome include:

frequent visits to hospitals in different areas
claiming to have a history of complex and serious medical conditions, yet there is little documentary evidence to support this; a common ruse is for people to claim they have spent a long time out of the country
symptoms that do not correspond to the results of tests
symptoms that get worse for no apparent reason
the person has a extremely good medical knowledge
the person receives very few, or no, visitors in hospital; many people with Munchausen’s syndrome adopt a solitary lifestyle and have little contact with any friends of family
a willingness to undergo often painful or dangerous tests and procedures
if confronted about their behaviour, they can become aggressive and will try to leave the hospital

There are four main ways in which people with Munchausen’s syndrome can feign or induce illnesses, which are outlined below:

lying about symptoms – often they choose symptoms that are hard to disprove, such as having severe headaches or they may pretend to have a seizure or pass out
tampering with test results – such as heating thermometers to suggest fever or adding blood to urine samples
self-infliction – they may cut or burn themselves, poison themselves with drugs or an overdose of medication, or eat food that has been contaminated with bacteria
aggravate pre-existing conditions – such as rubbing dirt or dog faeces into wounds to cause an infection, or reopen previously healed wounds
"
Myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME) or chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS),"The symptoms of the condition vary from person to person. There may be times when your symptoms improve and you’ll be able to do some normal everyday activities. At other times, symptoms may get worse, affecting your daily life.
If you experience new symptoms, talk to your GP or specialist as the new symptoms may be unrelated to ME/CFS. Women often find that symptoms worsen at different times in their menstrual cycle. Not everyone will experience all of the symptoms.
People with ME/CFS experience severe pain, fatigue and a range of other symptoms associated with PEM. This is the body and brain’s inability to recover after using even small amounts of energy.
Simple physical or mental activities, or combinations of activities, can leave people with ME/CFS feeling completely exhausted. It can also lead to an increase in other symptoms.
Other symptoms of ME/CFS include:

feeling generally unwell
pain
broken sleep
problems with concentration, thinking and memory (‘brain fog’)
speech and language problems, including word-finding difficulties
poor temperature control
dizziness
being very sensitive to light and sound
nausea
loss of appetite
muscle pain (myalgia)

Read more about the symptoms of ME/CFS
Frustration, anxiety, low mood and depression are sometimes experienced by people with ME/CFS because of the impact of the condition and its symptoms on their lives. This does not mean that ME/CFS is a mental health condition."
Myasthenia gravis,"The first symptoms of myasthenia gravis are often droopy eyelids or double vision. It usually affects the eyes first and may spread to other parts of the body. It can take weeks, months or years for symptoms to develop in other parts of the body.
The severity of the symptoms is different for each person. It’s likely that your symptoms will tend to get worse when you’re tired. The symptoms might improve after resting.
Symptoms can include:
It can be difficult to diagnose myasthenia gravis. Your doctor will ask about your medical history and symptoms.
You might need several tests to rule out other causes of your symptoms before you can be diagnosed with myasthenia gravis.
There are treatments available that can help reduce the affects of your symptoms.
If your symptoms get worse following certain triggers, you should try to avoid those triggers as much as possible.
Triggers might include:

stress
tiredness
infections
medicines
surgery

Treatment might include: "
Nasal and sinus cancer,"The most common symptoms of nasal and sinus cancer are:

a persistent blocked nose, which usually only affects 1 side
nosebleeds
mucus draining from the nose, which may be blood-stained
a decreased sense of smell

These symptoms can be similar to more common and less serious conditions, such as a cold or sinusitis.
At a later stage, symptoms can include:

pain or numbness in the face
swollen glands in the neck
partial loss of vision or double vision
a bulging or persistently watering eye
a lump or growth on your face, nose or roof of your mouth

Speak to your GP if you notice any unusual or persistent symptoms. They’re very unlikely to be caused by nasal or sinus cancer, but are worth getting checked out.
If your GP thinks you might need some tests to determine what’s causing your symptoms, you’ll usually be referred to an ear, nose and throat (ENT) consultant in hospital.
Tests you may have include:

a nasal endoscopy – where a long, thin, flexible tube attached to a light source is inserted into your nose to examine the area
a computerised tomography (CT) scan and a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan
a biopsy (where a small sample of tissue is removed and examined) – this may be done during an endoscopy or using a needle

Several factors are known to increase the risk of developing nasal and sinus cancer, including:

your gender – men are more likely to develop nasal and sinus cancer than women
prolonged exposure to certain substances through your work, including wood dust, leather dust, nickel, chromium and formaldehyde
smoking – the more you smoke, the higher your risk of developing several types of cancer, including nasal and sinus cancer
human papilloma virus (HPV) – a group of viruses that affect the skin and moist membranes, such as the mouth and throat

The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) has produced a report on the risk of occupational nasal and sinus cancer in Great Britain (PDF, 2Mb).
The best treatment depends on several factors, including how far the cancer has spread and your general health.
Treatment may include:

surgery to remove a tumour – which can be performed using surgical incisions (open surgery) or as keyhole surgery through the nose (endoscopic microsurgery)
radiotherapy – where high-energy radiation is used to kill the cancerous cells, shrink a tumour before surgery, or destroy small amounts of a tumour that may be left after surgery
chemotherapy – where medicine is used to help shrink or slow down the growth of a tumour, or to reduce the risk of the cancer returning after surgery

Your treatment will be organised by a head and neck cancer multidisciplinary team (MDT), who will discuss the treatment options with you. A combination of treatments will often be recommended."
Nasopharyngeal cancer,"It’s often difficult to recognise nasopharyngeal cancer because the symptoms are similar to other, less serious conditions. Also, many people with nasopharyngeal cancer don’t have any symptoms until the cancer reaches an advanced stage.
Symptoms of nasopharyngeal cancer can include:

a lump in the neck
hearing loss – usually only in 1 ear
tinnitus – hearing sounds that come from inside the body rather than from an outside source
a blocked or stuffy nose
nosebleeds

Speak to your GP if you develop any worrying symptoms, particularly if they don’t improve after a few weeks. While they’re very unlikely to be caused by nasopharyngeal cancer, it’s best to get them checked out.
The exact cause of nasopharyngeal cancer is unknown, but a number of factors can increase your risk of developing the condition. These include:

being of south Chinese or north African descent
having a diet very high in salt-cured meats and fish
being exposed to the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a common virus that causes glandular fever
having a job where you’re regularly exposed to hardwood dust
having a first-degree relative, such as a parent, who’s had the condition

Being exposed to the human papilloma virus (HPV) may also increase your risk of developing certain types of nasopharyngeal cancer.
About 3 times as many men as women are affected by nasopharyngeal cancer. The average age at diagnosis is about 50.
If you see your GP with symptoms that could indicate nasopharyngeal cancer, they’ll usually ask about your symptoms and carry out some examinations. This may involve examining your throat using a small mirror and a light.
If your GP thinks further tests are necessary, they’ll refer you to hospital. At hospital, a number of different tests may be carried out to check for nasopharyngeal cancer and rule out other conditions.
Some of the tests you may have include:

a nasendoscopy – where a thin, flexible telescope (endoscope) is inserted up your nose and passed down your throat to look for any abnormalities; it’s carried out while you’re awake, but local anaesthetic can be used to numb your nose and throat
imaging scans – magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans or computerised tomography (CT) scans can be used to check for tumours and determine whether the cancer has spread
a panendoscopy – a more detailed examination of your nose and throat carried out under general anaesthetic (where you’re unconscious) using a series of small, rigid telescopes connected together
a biopsy – where a small tissue sample is removed during a panendoscopy so it can be examined in a laboratory

Once these tests are complete, your doctors will be able to confirm whether you have nasopharyngeal cancer. They’ll also be able to ‘stage’ the cancer, which means giving it a score to describe how large it is and how far it has spread.
The Cancer Research UK website has more information about the stages of nasopharyngeal cancer.
If you’re diagnosed with nasopharyngeal cancer, you’ll be cared for by a team of different specialists who work together called a multidisciplinary team (MDT). Members of your MDT will discuss with you what they think the best treatment option is in your case.
The 2 main treatments for nasopharyngeal cancer are:

radiotherapy – where radiation is used to kill cancer cells
chemotherapy – where medication is used to kill cancer cells

In most cases, a combination of radiotherapy and chemotherapy will be used.
Surgery isn’t usually used to treat nasopharyngeal cancer as it’s difficult for surgeons to access the affected area.
Radiotherapy is the most commonly used treatment for nasopharyngeal cancer. It can be used on its own to treat very early-stage cancers, or in combination with chemotherapy for more advanced cancers.
In most cases, external radiotherapy is used. This involves using a machine to focus high-energy radiation beams on to the area that requires treatment.
In nasopharyngeal cancer, an advanced form of external radiotherapy called intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is used.
It involves aiming radiation beams of different strengths at a tumour from several different angles. This helps maximise the dose delivered to the tumour, while minimising the effect on the surrounding healthy tissue.
Stereotactic radiotherapy is another way of giving radiotherapy externally and may be used to target a specific area where the cancer has returned.
External radiotherapy is often given in short sessions, once a day from Monday to Friday, with a break at weekends. This is usually carried out for up to 7 weeks. You won’t need to stay in hospital overnight between these appointments.
In some cases, internal radiotherapy may be required where nasopharyngeal cancer has returned after initial treatment. A radioactive source is placed into or near the cancerous area and left in place for anywhere from a few minutes to a few days.
Depending on the type of treatment you have, you may need to stay in hospital for a short period of time.
Radiotherapy itself is painless, but it can have some significant side effects, such as:

red and sore skin in the treatment area
feeling sick
changes to your sense of taste
dry mouth 
hair loss

These side effects are usually temporary, but some can be permanent. Let your care team know if you experience these problems as treatment is often available to help.
Read more about how radiotherapy is performed and the side effects of radiotherapy
Chemotherapy may be used before or alongside radiotherapy for more advanced nasopharyngeal cancers.
It’s usually given through a drip into a vein (intravenous chemotherapy), with sessions every 3 to 4 weeks spread over several months. You won’t usually need to stay in hospital overnight during treatment.
Like radiotherapy, chemotherapy can cause a number of significant side effects, such as:

feeling sick
diarrhoea
sore mouth
tiredness

These side effects are usually temporary, but there’s also a risk of longer-term problems, such as infertility. You should discuss any concerns you have about the potential side effects of treatment with your care team before treatment begins.
Read more about how chemotherapy is performed and the side effects of chemotherapy
After your course of treatment ends, you’ll need to have regular follow-up appointments and scans to monitor your recovery and check for any signs of the cancer returning.
To start with, these appointments will be every few weeks or months, but they’ll become gradually less frequent over time."
Neck problems,
Neuroblastoma: Children,
Neuroendocrine tumours,"The symptoms of a neuroendocrine tumour can vary depending on where it is and what hormones it produces.
For example, a tumour in the digestive system may cause diarrhoea, constipation or tummy pains. A tumour in the lung may cause wheezing or a persistent cough.
Some tumours (functioning tumours) may cause abnormally large amounts of hormones to be released into the bloodstream.
This can cause symptoms such as diarrhoea, flushing, cramps, wheezing, low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia), changes in blood pressure and heart problems.
What causes neuroendocrine tumours isn’t fully understood. However, your chance of developing a NET is increased if you have one of the following rare conditions or syndromes:

multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN 1) – a rare inherited condition where tumours in the endocrine system develop, most commonly in the parathyroid glands, pituitary gland and the pancreas
neurofibrmatosis type 1 – a group of genetic conditions that cause tumours to grow along your nerves
Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome (VHL) – an inherited condition that causes blood vessels to grow abnormally

Research has also shown that your risk of developing a NET is slightly increased if one of your parents has had one in the past.
There are many tests that can be used to diagnose NETs, including blood tests, urine tests, scans, and a biopsy (where a small tissue sample is taken for closer examination).
Different types of scans may also be used to identify or examine tumours. These include:

ultrasound scans – including echocardiograms and endoscopic ultrasound scans
computerised tomography (CT) scans
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans
positron emission tomography (PET) scans
octreotide scans – where mild radioactive liquid is injected into your veins and a special camera is used to highlight any cancerous cells

How a neuroendocrine tumour is treated will depend on your individual circumstances. For example, your treatment will depend on:

where the tumour is
how advanced your condition is
your overall health

Unfortunately, many people are only diagnosed after other parts of their body are affected. However, it may still be possible to surgically remove the tumour, even if it has spread to other parts of your body.
If surgery can’t be used to completely cure your condition, it may be used to help manage and reduce any symptoms that you have.
It may also be possible to shrink the tumour or stop further growth using treatments that block the blood supply to the tumour (embolisation), or chemotherapy, radiotherapy or radiofrequency ablation (where heat is used to destroy the cells).
The Cancer Research UK website has more information about neuroendocrine tumours (NETs).
If you have neuroendocrine tumours, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS).
This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time.
Find out more about the register."
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD),"There aren’t usually any symptoms of NAFLD in the early stages. You probably won’t know you have it unless it’s diagnosed during tests carried out for another reason.
Occasionally, people with NASH or fibrosis (more advanced stages of the disease) may experience:

a dull or aching pain in the top right of the tummy (over the lower right side of the ribs)
fatigue (extreme tiredness)
unexplained weight loss
weakness

If cirrhosis (the most advanced stage) develops, you can get more severe symptoms such as yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes (jaundice), itchy skin, and swelling in the legs, ankles, feet or tummy.
Read more about the symptoms of cirrhosis.
NAFLD is often diagnosed after a blood test called a liver function test produces an abnormal result and other liver conditions, such as hepatitis, are ruled out. However, blood tests don’t always pick up NAFLD.
The condition may also be spotted during an ultrasound scan of your tummy. This is a type of scan where sound waves are used to create an image of the inside of your body.
If you’re diagnosed with NAFLD, further tests may be needed to determine which stage you have. This may involve a special blood test or having another type of ultrasound scan (Fibroscan). Some people may also need a small sample of liver tissue (biopsy) taken using a needle to have it analysed in a laboratory.
Most people with NAFLD won’t develop any serious problems, but if you’re diagnosed with the condition it’s a good idea to take steps to stop it getting any worse.
There’s currently no specific medication for NAFLD, but making healthy lifestyle choices can help and treatment may be recommended for associated conditions (high blood pressure, diabetes and cholesterol) or complications.
You may be advised to have regular appointments with your doctor to check your liver function and look for signs of any new problems.
Adopting a healthy lifestyle is the main way of managing NAFLD. The following can all help. 
Lose weight – you should aim for a BMI of 18.5-24.9. Losing more than 10% of your weight can remove some fat from the liver and improve NASH if you have it.
Eat a healthy diet – try to have a balanced diet high in fruits, vegetables, protein and carbohydrates, but low in fat, sugar and salt. Eating smaller portions of food can help too.
Exercise regularly – aim to do at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity, such as walking or cycling, a week. All types of exercise can help improve NAFLD, even if you don’t lose weight.
Stop smoking – if you smoke, stopping can help reduce your risk of problems such as heart attacks and strokes.
NAFLD isn’t caused by alcohol, but drinking may make the condition worse. It’s therefore advisable to cut down or stop drinking alcohol. Read some tips on cutting down on alcohol.
There isn’t currently any medication that can treat NAFLD, but various medicines can be useful in managing the problems associated with the condition.
For example, your doctor may recommend medication to treat high blood pressure, treat high cholesterol, treat type 2 diabetes and/or treat obesity.
If you develop severe cirrhosis and your liver stops working properly, you may need to be put on the waiting list for a liver transplant.
For adults, the average waiting time for a liver transplant is 145 days for transplants from recently deceased donors.
Alternatively, it may be possible to have a transplant using a section of liver removed from a living donor. As the liver can regenerate itself, both the transplanted section and the remaining section of the donor’s liver are able to regrow to a normal size.
Read more about liver transplants. "
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma,"The most common symptom of non-Hodgkin lymphoma is a painless swelling in a lymph node, usually in the neck, armpit or groin.
Lymph nodes, also known as lymph glands, are pea-sized lumps of tissue found throughout the body. They contain white blood cells that help to fight against infection.
The swelling is caused by a certain type of white blood cell, known as lymphocytes, collecting in the lymph node.
However, it’s highly unlikely you have non-Hodgkin lymphoma if you have swollen lymph nodes, as these glands often swell as a response to infection.
Some people with non-Hodgkin lymphoma also have other more general symptoms. These can include:

night sweats
unintentional weight loss 
a high temperature (fever)
a persistent cough or feeling of breathlessness
persistent itching of the skin all over the body

Other symptoms depend on where in the body the enlarged lymph glands are. For example, if the abdomen (tummy) is affected, you may have abdominal pain or indigestion.
A few people with lymphoma have abnormal cells in their bone marrow when they’re diagnosed. This may lead to:

persistent tiredness or fatigue
an increased risk of infections
excessive bleeding – such as nosebleeds, heavy periods and spots of blood under the skin

Speak to your GP if you have any of these symptoms, particularly if you have persistently swollen glands with no other signs of infection.
While the symptoms are unlikely to be caused by non-Hodgkin lymphoma, it’s best to get them checked out."
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma: Children,
Norovirus,"You’re likely to have norovirus if you experience:

suddenly feeling sick
projectile vomiting
watery diarrhoea

Some people also have a slight fever, headaches, painful stomach cramps and aching limbs.
The symptoms appear 1 to 2 days after you become infected and typically last for up to 2 or 3 days.
Norovirus spreads very easily in public places such as hospitals, nursing homes and schools.
You can catch it if small particles of vomit or stools (poo) from an infected person get into your mouth through:

close contact with someone with norovirus who may breathe out small particles of the virus that you then inhale
touching contaminated surfaces or objects, as the virus can survive outside the body for several days
eating contaminated food, which can happen if an infected person doesn’t wash their hands before preparing or handling food

You can get norovirus more than once because the virus is always changing and your body is unable to build up long-term resistance to it.
It’s not always possible to avoid getting norovirus, but following the advice can help stop the virus spreading. You should:

stay off work or school until at least 48 hours after the norovirus symptoms have stopped
avoid visiting anyone in hospital during this time
wash your hands frequently and thoroughly with soap and water particularly after using the toilet and before preparing or handling food
be aware alcohol-based hand gels don’t kill the virus

Maintain basic hygiene and cleaning to help stop the spread of norovirus by:

disinfecting any surfaces or objects that could be contaminated, using a bleach-based household cleaner.
washing any items of clothing or bedding that could have become contaminated separately on a hot wash (60°C) to ensure the virus is killed.
not sharing towels and flannels
flushing any poo or vomit in the toilet and cleaning the surrounding area with a bleach-based household cleaner
avoiding eating raw, unwashed food
only eating oysters from a reliable source as they can carry norovirus

If you experience sudden diarrhoea and/or vomiting, the best thing to do is to stay at home until you’re feeling better.
There’s no treatment for norovirus, so you have to let it run its course.
You don’t usually need to get medical advice unless there’s a risk of a more serious problem.
To help ease your own or your child’s symptoms drink plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration.
You need to drink more than usual to replace the fluids lost from vomiting and diarrhoea – as well as water, adults could also try fruit juice and soup.
Avoid giving fizzy drinks or fruit juice to children as it can make their diarrhoea worse. Babies should continue to feed as usual, either with breast milk or other milk feeds.
You can also:

take paracetamol for any fever or aches and pains
get plenty of rest
use special rehydration drinks, available from community pharmacies if you have signs of dehydration, such as a dry mouth or dark urine

If you feel like eating, try plain foods, such as soup, rice, pasta and bread.
Babies and young children, especially under a year old, have a greater risk of becoming dehydrated.
You don’t normally need to see your GP if you think you or your child has norovirus, as there’s no specific treatment for it.
Antibiotics won’t help because norovirus is caused by a virus."
Nosebleed,
Obesity,
Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD),"OCD affects people differently. It usually causes a particular pattern of thought and behaviour.
This pattern has 4 main steps:

Obsession – where an intrusive, distressing thought, image or urge repeatedly enters your mind.
Anxiety – the obsession provokes a feeling of intense anxiety or distress.
Compulsion – repetitive behaviours or mental acts that you feel you have to do as a result of the anxiety and distress caused by the obsession.
Temporary relief – the compulsive behaviour brings temporary relief, but the obsession and anxiety return, causing the cycle to begin again.

Almost everyone has unpleasant or unwanted thoughts at some point in their life. This might be a concern that you’ve forgotten to lock the door of the house or that you might get a disease from touching other people. It could be sudden unwelcome violent or offensive mental images.
Most people are able to put these types of thoughts and concerns into context. They can then carry on with their day-to-day life. They do not repeatedly think about worries they know have little substance.
If you have persistent and unwanted thoughts that dominates your thinking, you may have developed an obsession.
Some common obsessions that affect people with OCD include:

fear of deliberately harming yourself or others – for example, fear you may attack someone else, even though this type of behaviour disgusts you
fear of harming yourself or others by mistake or accident – for example, fear you may set the house on fire by accidentally leaving the cooker on
fear of contamination by disease, infection or an unpleasant substance
a need for symmetry or orderliness – for example, you may feel the need to ensure all the tins in your cupboard face the same way

Compulsions happen as a way of trying to reduce or prevent the harm of the obsessive thought. However, this behaviour is either excessive or not connected at all.
For example, a person who fears becoming contaminated with dirt and germs may wash their hands repeatedly. Or someone with a fear of causing harm to their family may have the urge to repeat an action multiple times to try to ‘neutralise’ the thought of harm. This type of compulsive behaviour is particularly common in children with OCD.
Most people with OCD realise that such compulsive behaviour is irrational. They might know it makes no logical sense, but they cannot stop acting on their compulsion.
Not all compulsive behaviours will be obvious to other people.
Some people with OCD may also have or develop other mental health problems, including:

depression
eating disorders
generalised anxiety disorder
a hoarding disorder

People with OCD and severe depression might also have suicidal feelings."
Obstructive sleep apnoea,"Signs of OSA can include:

being very sleepy during the day
breathing pauses through the night – this may be noticed by a partner, friend or relative
loud snoring
noisy and/or laboured breathing
repeated periods where breathing stops or is interrupted by gasping or snorting

Some people with OSA may also experience night sweats and may wake up often during the night to pee.
During an episode, the lack of oxygen triggers your brain to pull you out of deep sleep either to a lighter sleep or to wakefulness. Your airway then reopens and you can breathe normally. These repeated sleep interruptions can make you feel very tired and more likely to fall asleep during the day. You’ll usually have no memory of your interrupted breathing, so you may be unaware you have a problem.
They can check for other possible reasons for your symptoms and may refer you to a sleep specialist.
Before seeing your GP it may be helpful to ask a partner, friend or relative to watch you while you’re asleep, if possible. If you have OSA, they may be able to spot breathing pauses.
It may also help to fill out an Epworth Sleepiness Scale questionnaire. This asks how likely it is for you to doze off in different situations. For example, watching TV, sitting in a meeting or while driving. The final score will help your doctor determine whether you may have a sleep disorder.
Your GP will usually ask questions about your symptoms. They may also take your blood pressure and a blood sample. This can help to rule out other conditions that may explain your tiredness. For example, an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism) or anaemia.
The next step will usually be an assessment through the night (sleep study). Your sleeping pattern will be checked to find whether or not you have a high number of breathing pauses through the night. It’s common to have breathing pauses through the night but a high number is abnormal. Your GP can refer you to specialist clinics or hospital departments that help investigate and treat people with sleep disorders.
The sleep specialists at the sleep centre may ask you about your symptoms and medical history, and carry out a physical examination.
This may include measuring your height and weight to work out your body mass index (BMI), as well as measuring your neck circumference. This is because being overweight and having a large neck can increase your risk of OSA.
The sleep specialists will then arrange for your sleep to be assessed overnight. This can be done either by:

taking some monitoring equipment home with you and bringing it back the next day for them to analyse – this is common
spending the night at the clinic – this is rare

In many cases the sleep centre will teach you how to use portable recording equipment while you sleep at home.
The equipment you are given may include:

a breathing sensor at your nose or mouth
sensors to monitor your heart rate
bands that are placed around your chest
oxygen sensors that are put on your finger
a small sensor that sticks on your chin

The equipment records oxygen levels, breathing movements, heart rate, snoring, and body sleeping position through the night.
If more information is needed, you may be asked to spend the night at the sleep centre.
The main test carried out to analyse your sleep at a sleep centre is known as polysomnography.
During the night, several different parts of your body will be carefully monitored while you sleep.
Bands and small metallic discs called electrodes are placed on the surface of your skin and different parts of your body. Sensors are also placed on your legs and an oxygen sensor will be attached to your finger.
Different tests will be carried out during polysomnography, including:

electroencephalography (EEG) – this monitors brain waves
electromyography (EMG) – this monitors muscle tone
recordings of movements in your chest and abdomen
recordings of airflow through your mouth and nose
pulse oximetry – this measures your heart rate and blood oxygen levels
electrocardiography (ECG) – this monitors your heart

Sound recording and video equipment may also be used.
If OSA is diagnosed during the early part of the night, you may be given continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment. CPAP involves using a mask that delivers constant compressed air to the airway and stops it closing, which prevents OSA.
Once the tests have been completed, staff at the sleep centre should have a good idea about whether or not you have OSA. If you do, they can determine how much it is interrupting your sleep and recommend the right treatment.
The severity of OSA is determined by how many breathing pauses you have per hour of sleep. These episodes are measured using the apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI).
Severity is measured using the following criteria:

mild – an AHI reading of 5 to 14 episodes an hour
moderate – an AHI reading of 15 to 30 episodes an hour
severe – an AHI reading of more than 30 episodes an hour

Treatment is most likely to be beneficial in people with moderate or severe OSA. Treatment is also most likely to help people who are very sleepy during the day. However, treatment may also help some people with mild OSA.
There are treatments that can reduce the symptoms of OSA.
Lifestyle changes include:

losing weight
stopping smoking
cutting down on alcohol
sleeping on your side
avoiding sedative medications and sleeping tablets

People with moderate to severe OSA usually need to use a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) device. It delivers a continuous supply of compressed air through a mask. This prevents your airway closing while you sleep.
CPAP can feel peculiar to start with and you may be tempted to stop using it. But people who persevere usually soon get used to it and their symptoms improve significantly.
CPAP is available on the NHS and is the most effective therapy for treating severe cases of OSA. Telemonitoring may be used to check how well CPAP is working for you. Telemonitoring means healthcare professionals can check your use of CPAP therapy. They can see if there are any issues that they can help with and make adjustments where needed.
As well as reducing symptoms such as snoring and tiredness, it can also reduce the risk of complications of OSA in people who have symptoms, such as high blood pressure.
Possible side effects of using a CPAP device can include:

mask discomfort
nasal congestion, runny nose or irritation
difficulty breathing through your nose
headaches and ear pain
stomach pain and flatulence (wind)
claustrophobia

A mandibular advancement device (MAD) is a dental appliance, like a gum shield, sometimes used to treat mild OSA.
They’re not generally recommended for more severe OSA. But they may be an option if a CPAP device isn’t right for you.
A MAD is worn over your teeth when you’re asleep. It holds your jaw and tongue forward to increase the space at the back of your throat and reduce the narrowing of your airway that causes snoring.
It’s recommended you have a MAD made for you by a dentist with training and experience in treating sleep apnoea. MADs aren’t always available on the NHS, so you may need to pay for the device privately through a dentist or orthodontist.
A MAD may not be a suitable treatment for you if you don’t have many – or any – teeth. If you have dental caps, crowns or bridgework, speak to your dentist to make sure they won’t be stressed or damaged by a MAD.
Surgery may also be an option if OSA is thought to be the result of a physical problem that can be corrected surgically. For example, an enlarged tonsillar tissue. For most people surgery isn’t appropriate. It may only be considered as a last resort if other treatments haven’t helped.
OSA can have a significant impact on the quality of life for someone with the condition, as well as their friends and families.
It can cause physical problems tiredness and headaches. It can also have a significant emotional impact and affect your relationships with others.
Asthma + Lung UK and Sleep Apnoea Trust provide support and advice about living with OSA.
Treatments can often help control the symptoms of OSA, but they’ll need to be lifelong in most cases.
If OSA is left untreated, it can cause problems such as poor performance at work and school, and placing a strain on your relationships.
Poorly controlled OSA may also increase your risk of:

developing high blood pressure (hypertension)
having a stroke or heart attack
developing an irregular heartbeat – such as atrial fibrillation
developing type 2 diabetes – although it’s unclear if this is the result of an underlying cause, such as obesity

Someone who has been deprived of sleep because of OSA may be more likely to be involved in a car accident. If you’re diagnosed with OSA, it may mean your ability to drive is affected. You must inform the DVLA about a medical condition that could impact your driving ability.
Once a diagnosis of OSA has been made, you shouldn’t drive until your symptoms are well controlled.
GOV.UK has advice about how to tell the DVLA about a medical condition."
Oesophageal cancer,"Oesophageal cancer doesn’t usually cause any symptoms in the early stages when the tumour is small. It’s only when it gets bigger that symptoms tend to develop.
Symptoms of oesophageal cancer can include:

difficulty swallowing
persistent indigestion or heartburn
bringing up food soon after eating
loss of appetite and weight loss
pain or discomfort in your upper tummy, chest or back

Read more about the symptoms of oesophageal cancer
Speak to your GP if you experience:

swallowing difficulties
heartburn on most days for three weeks or more
any other unusual or persistent symptoms

The symptoms can be caused by several conditions and in many cases won’t be caused by cancer – but it’s a good idea to get them checked out.
If your GP thinks you need to have some tests, they can refer you to a hospital specialist.
Read about how oesophageal cancer is diagnosed"
Oral thrush in adults,
Osteoarthritis,"The main symptoms of osteoarthritis are pain and stiffness in your joints. This can make it difficult to move the affected joints and do certain activities.
The symptoms may come and go, which can be related to things like your activity levels and even the weather. In more severe cases, the symptoms can be continuous.
Other symptoms you or your healthcare professional may notice include:

joint tenderness
increased pain and stiffness when you have not moved your joints for a while
joints appearing slightly larger or more ‘knobbly’ than usual
a grating or crackling sound or sensation in your joints
limited range of movement in your joints
weakness and loss of muscle bulk

Osteoarthritis can affect any joint in the body. The most common areas affected are the knees, hips, and small joints in the hands. Often, you will only experience symptoms in one joint or a few joints at any one time."
Osteoarthritis of the hip,"These can vary from person to person.
People may experience some or all of these symptoms including:

pain in or around the hip joint, groin area, buttock or front thigh that can be worse when moving or doing activities. 
stiffness in the hip, often in the morning or after resting.
locking, sticking or grinding of the hip
weakness in the buttock muscles.  
difficulty in daily activities such as walking, going up/down stairs, getting up from a chair or out of a car.

In order for osteoarthritis of the hip to be diagnosed you will need an assessment from a healthcare professional.
They’ll initially ask you questions about your hip issue and then carry out a physical examination. This will include checking your range of movement and strength.
An x-ray of the hip is sometimes used to help diagnosis. You may sometimes need to have a further examination to rule out other possible health conditions.
While there is no cure for osteoarthritis, the condition can be successfully self-managed in a number of cases. 
Osteoarthritis of the hip can range in severity; some people can have significant changes shown on an x-ray with mild symptoms and others can have severe symptoms with little physical change.
For both cases, and those in between, treatment would begin with the same approach. Keeping the joint mobile is the best way to manage your symptoms.
You can manage your symptoms by:

pacing your activities throughout the day. 
adapt activities which increase your pain or you find difficult.  
avoid low seating if possible.
wearing supportive footwear with cushioned soles and avoiding high heels.  
avoiding sitting in one position for long periods. 

Strengthening muscles around your hip will help manage your symptoms.

Osteoporosis,
Osteosarcoma,
Outer ear infection (otitis externa),"Symptoms of otitis externa include:

ear pain
itching and irritation in and around your ear canal
redness and swelling of your outer ear and ear canal
a feeling of pressure and fullness inside your ear
scaly skin in and around your ear canal, which may peel off
discharge from your ear, which can be either thin and watery or thick and pus-like
tenderness when you move your ear or jaw
swollen and sore glands in your throat
some hearing loss

Usually, only one ear is affected.
With treatment, these symptoms should clear up within a few days. Some cases can persist for several months or longer.
Pharmacists can give advice and treatment about outer ear infections.
Your pharmacist may advise you to speak to your GP practice if needed.
Your pharmacist or GP will ask about your symptoms and whether you regularly put things into your ears, such as hearing aids or ear plugs. They may also examine inside your ear using an instrument called an otoscope.
If you have otitis externa often, and treatment doesn’t help, your GP may take a swab of the inside of your ear. This will be tested to help check what type of infection you have, if any, so the right medication can be prescribed.
Most cases of otitis externa are caused by a bacterial infection. It can also be caused by:

irritation
fungal infections
allergies

There are a things that can make you more likely to develop otitis externa, including:

damaging the skin inside your ear – for example by scratching or picking your ear
regularly getting water in your ear – for example by swimming

Getting water in your ear can cause you to scratch inside your ear, and the moisture also provides an ideal environment for bacteria to grow.
Otitis externa is quite common. It’s estimated that around 1 in 10 people will be affected by it at some point in their lives.
The condition is slightly more common in women than men and is most often diagnosed in adults 45 to 75 years of age.
People with certain long-term (chronic) conditions are at greater risk of developing the condition. These include:

eczema
dermatitis

Otitis externa sometimes gets better without treatment, but it can take several weeks.
To help your symptoms and help prevent complications, you should:

avoid getting your affected ear wet – wearing a shower cap while showering and bathing if you aren’t washing your hair can help
avoid swimming until the condition has fully cleared
remove any discharge by gently swabbing your outer ear with cotton wool – do not stick cotton wool or a cotton bud inside your ear
remove anything from your affected ear that may cause an allergic reaction, such as hearing aids, ear plugs and earrings
use pain relief such as paracetamol or ibuprofen to relieve ear pain – these aren’t suitable for everyone, so make sure you check the information leaflet that comes with the medication first and if you’re still unsure, check with your GP, practice nurse or pharmacist
if your condition is caused by a boil in your ear, placing a warm flannel or cloth over the affected ear can help it heal faster

Your pharmacist or GP can prescribe ear drops that usually improve symptoms within a few days.
There are different types of ear drops that may be used to treat otitis externa. You usually use them several times a day for about a week.
Your GP may refer you to a specialist for further treatment and advice if your symptoms are severe, or treatment does not help.
There are things you can do to reduce your chances of developing otitis externa.
You should also try to avoid getting water, soap or shampoo into your ears when you have a shower or bath."
Ovarian cancer,"The symptoms of ovarian cancer can be difficult to recognise, particularly in its early stages.
This is because they are often the same as symptoms of other less serious conditions, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or pre-menstrual syndrome (PMS).
However, 3 main symptoms are more frequent:

increased abdominal size and persistent bloating (not bloating that comes and goes)
persistent pelvic and abdominal pain
difficulty eating and feeling full quickly, or feeling nauseous

Other symptoms, such as back pain, needing to pass urine more frequently than usual, and pain during sex may be the result of other conditions in the pelvic area. However, they may be a sign of ovarian cancer.
If you have these types of symptoms, try keeping a diary to record how many of these symptoms you have over a longer period. Bear in mind that ovarian cancer is rare in women and anyone with ovaries under 40 years of age.
Speak to your GP if you have these symptoms regularly (on most days for 3 weeks or more). Although it’s unlikely they’re being caused by a serious problem, it’s best to check.
If you’ve already seen your GP and the symptoms continue or get worse, you should go back and explain this. You know your body better than anyone."
Ovarian cancer: Teenagers and young adults,
Ovarian cyst,
Overactive thyroid,"If you have hyperthyroidism, you may experience some of the following symptoms:

hyperactivity
mood swings – such as anxiety, irritability and nervousness
difficulty sleeping (insomnia)
feeling tired all the time (fatigue)
muscle weakness
needing to poo or pee more frequently
excess fats in your poo – which can make them greasy and difficult to flush down the toilet (steatorrhoea)
sensitivity to heat and excess sweating
unexplained or unexpected weight loss – despite having an increased appetite (though in a small number of cases, the increase in appetite can lead to weight gain)
very infrequent or light periods, or periods stopping altogether
infertility
loss of interest in sex 

If you have diabetes, your diabetic symptoms, such as extreme thirst and tiredness, may be made worse by hyperthyroidism.
If you have hyperthyroidism, you may have some of the following physical signs:

a swelling in your neck caused by an enlarged thyroid gland (goitre)
irregular and/or unusually fast heart rate (palpitations)
trembling or shaking (tremor)
warm, moist skin
redness on the palms of your hands
loosening of your nails in their nail beds
hives (urticaria)
patchy hair loss (alopecia)
twitching in your face and limbs

See your GP if you are experiencing any of these symptoms. They may not be the result of an overactive thyroid gland, but they will need further investigation.
It might be useful to make a list of your symptoms, as this can often be helpful in determining the correct diagnosis."
Pain in the ball of the foot,"Pain in the ball of the foot tends to develop gradually over time.
The pain is sometimes described as:

a burning or aching sensation
a shooting pain
tingling or numbness in the toes
a feeling like there’s a small stone stuck under the foot

The pain is usually the result of increased pressure on the ball of the foot.
Some common causes include:

badly fitting footwear with high-heeled or narrow toes
high-impact sports, like running or tennis
being overweight as this can increase the pressure on the feet

Pain in the ball of the foot can also be related to health issues, including arthritis and diabetes.
Exercises should relieve pain and improve flexibility in the affected foot. To do this try exercises designed to stretch both your calf muscles and strengthen the muscles in your feet
While recovering you should try to stay as active as you can.
A little activity is better than nothing. Continue to stay within acceptable pain limits but remember you don’t need to be pain free. Aim to do a little bit more each day or every few days.
The following can help to reduce the pain.
Pain medication – this can help you move more comfortably, which can help your recovery
More about taking painkillers
You should avoid wearing hard, unsupportive, flat-soled shoes because they won’t provide your foot with support. This could make your foot pain worse.
Try to wear well fitted shoes that support and cushion your feet. Running shoes are particularly useful.
Supportive devices (like insoles) can be used if other treatments haven’t worked. While they can help some not everyone would benefit from using them.
A healthcare professional would suggest which devices would be appropriate for you to use.
Keeping active is an essential part of your treatment and recovery and is the single best thing you can do for your health.
Being physically active can:

maintain your current levels of fitness – even if you have to modify what you normally do, any activity is better than none
keep your other muscles and joints strong and flexible
prevent a recurrence of the problem
help you aim for a healthy body weight

If painkillers aren’t helping to control the pain, your healthcare professional may discuss having a corticosteroid injection into your foot.
Corticosteroids are medicines that help reduce pain and inflammation. They may also be given with a local anaesthetic.
Injections won’t cure your condition, they’re used to help with the symptoms.

Paget’s disease of the nipple,"Paget’s disease usually affects the skin of one nipple and produces eczema-like symptoms, appearing as an itchy, red rash on the nipple that can extend to the darker area of surrounding skin (the areola).
It can also appear as a small ulcer or dry, red, flaky patches of skin similar to psoriasis.
Other possible symptoms include:

itchiness or a burning sensation – alongside visible changes to the nipple
bleeding from the skin of the nipple

If you’re experiencing itchiness, burning or bleeding but the nipple looks normal and isn’t red, dry or scaly – this is extremely unlikely to be Paget’s disease but should still be checked by a doctor."
Pancreatic cancer,"In the early stages, a tumour in the pancreas doesn’t usually cause any symptoms, which can make it difficult to diagnose.
It’s important to remember that these symptoms can be caused by many different conditions, and aren’t usually the result of cancer. But you should contact your GP if you’re concerned, or if these symptoms start suddenly.
The first noticeable symptoms of pancreatic cancer are often:

pain in the back or stomach area – which may come and go at first and is often worse when you lie down or after you’ve eaten
unexpected weight loss
jaundice – the most obvious sign is yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes; it also causes your urine to be dark yellow or orange and your stools (faeces) to be pale-coloured

Other possible symptoms of pancreatic cancer include:

nausea and vomiting
bowel changes
fever and shivering
indigestion
blood clots

You may also develop symptoms of diabetes if you have pancreatic cancer, because it can produce chemicals that interfere with the normal effect of insulin.
There are also a number of different endocrine tumours that cause different symptoms, depending on the hormone the tumour produces."
Panic disorder,"The symptoms of a panic attack can be very frightening and distressing.
Symptoms tend to occur suddenly, without warning and often for no apparent reason.
As well as overwhelming feelings of anxiety, a panic attack can also cause a variety of other symptoms, including:

a sensation that your heart is beating irregularly (palpitations)
sweating
trembling
hot flushes
chills
shortness of breath 
a choking sensation
chest pain
nausea
dizziness
feeling faint
numbness or pins and needles
dry mouth
a need to go to the toilet
ringing in your ears 
a feeling of dread or a fear of dying
a churning stomach
a tingling sensation in your fingers
shivering
shaking

The physical symptoms of a panic attack are unpleasant, and they can also be accompanied by thoughts of fear and terror.
For this reason, people with panic disorder start to fear the next attack, which creates a cycle of living in ‘fear of fear’ and adds to the sense of panic.
Sometimes, the symptoms of a panic attack can be so intense they can make you feel like you’re having a heart attack.
However, it’s important to be aware that symptoms such as a racing heartbeat and shortness of breath won’t result in you having a heart attack. Although panic attacks can often be frightening, they don’t cause any physical harm. People who have had panic disorder for some time usually learn to recognise this ‘heart attack sensation’ and become more aware of how to control their symptoms.
Most panic attacks last for five to 20 minutes. Some attacks have been reported to have lasted up to an hour. However, it’s likely that in these cases one attack occurred straight after another or high levels of anxiety were felt after the first attack.
People with panic disorder have panic attacks on a recurring basis. Some people have attacks once or twice a month, while others have them several times a week.
People with panic disorder also tend to have ongoing and constant feelings of worry and anxiety. The panic attacks associated with panic disorder can be very unpredictable.
If you have panic disorder, you may also feel anxious about when your next attack will be.
During a panic attack your symptoms can be so intense and out of your control that you can feel detached from the situation, your body and your surroundings. It can almost feel as if you’re an observer, making the situation seem very unreal.
This sense of detachment is known as depersonalisation. Being detached from the situation doesn’t provide any relief or make a panic attack less frightening. Instead, it often makes the experience more confusing and disorientating."
Parkinson’s disease,"The symptoms of Parkinson’s disease usually develop gradually and are mild at first.
There are many different symptoms associated with Parkinson’s disease. Some of the more common symptoms are described below.
However, the order in which these develop and their severity is different for each individual. It’s unlikely that a person with Parkinson’s disease would experience all or most of these.
The three main symptoms of Parkinson’s disease affect physical movement:

tremor – shaking, which usually begins in the hand or arm and is more likely to occur when the limb is relaxed and resting
slowness of movement (bradykinesia) – where physical movements are much slower than normal, which can make everyday tasks difficult and can result in a distinctive slow, shuffling walk with very small steps
muscle stiffness (rigidity) – stiffness and tension in the muscles, which can make it difficult to move around and make facial expressions, and can result in painful muscle cramps (dystonia)

These main symptoms are sometimes referred to by doctors as parkinsonism as there can be causes other than Parkinson’s disease.
Parkinson’s disease can also cause a range of other physical and mental symptoms.

balance problems – these can make someone with the condition more likely to have a fall and injure themselves
loss of sense of smell (anosmia) – sometimes occurs several years before other symptoms develop
nerve pain – can cause unpleasant sensations, such as burning, coldness or numbness
problems with urination – such as having to get up frequently during the night to urinate or unintentionally passing urine (urinary incontinence)
constipation
an inability to obtain or sustain an erection (erectile dysfunction) in men 
difficulty becoming sexually aroused and achieving an orgasm (sexual dysfunction) in women
dizziness, blurred vision or fainting when moving from a sitting or lying position to a standing one – caused by a sudden drop in blood pressure
excessive sweating (hyperhidrosis)
swallowing difficulties (dysphagia) – this can lead to malnutrition and dehydration
excessive production of saliva (drooling)
problems sleeping (insomnia) – this can result in excessive sleepiness during the day


depression and anxiety
mild cognitive impairment – slight memory problems and problems with activities that require planning and organisation
dementia – a group of symptoms, including more severe memory problems, personality changes, seeing things that aren’t there (visual hallucinations) and believing things that aren’t true (delusions)

See your GP if you’re concerned you may have symptoms of Parkinson’s disease.
Your GP will ask about your symptoms and your medical history to help them decide whether it’s necessary to refer you to a specialist for further tests.

Patau’s syndrome,
Patellofemoral pain syndrome,"These can vary from person to person.
People may experience some or all of these symptoms including:

pain beneath or around the kneecap especially on climbing up and down stairs, kneeling and squatting.                     
clicking and grinding in the knee.  
giving way of the knee or sensation of this.  
pain after maintaining a sitting position for a period of time, such as driving or at the cinema. 
swelling.  
tight feeling in the calves and thighs.

The causes can vary between individuals, but it’s often as a result of altered loading of the patella (kneecap). 
The main contributing factors can be:  

weakness in the buttocks and thighs.
tightness in the hamstrings and calf. 
sudden changes in activities.

Other factors could be:

repeated kneeling or bending of the knee.
sitting or driving for a prolonged period of time.
being overweight. 

The strongest evidence suggests that strengthening any weak or underactive muscles and stretching any short or tight muscles is very important.
An important step in your recovery is identifying which activities are causing or increasing your pain. Modifying those activities can help to reduce symptoms, however, it’s important to make sure you remain active.
Modifying your activities may include:

reducing the amount of kneeling
take regular breaks while doing aggravating activities
reduce the amount of time you sit still

Pelvic inflammatory disease,"PID often does not cause any obvious symptoms.
Most symptoms are mild, making it difficult to diagnose.
Symptoms include:

pain around the pelvis or lower tummy
discomfort or pain during sex that is felt deep inside the pelvis
pain when peeing
bleeding between periods or after sex
heavy periods
painful periods
unusual vaginal discharge

Less common symptoms include:

severe tummy pain
a high temperature (fever)
feeling and being sick

If you think you might have PID, get checked for free by:

booking an appointment at your local sexual health service
contacting your GP practice for an appointment

There is no single test for diagnosing PID.
Your doctor or nurse will discuss your symptoms before you have an internal examination. This shouldn’t be painful, but you may experience some discomfort.
When your doctor examines you, they’ll look for tenderness in your pelvic region and an abnormal vaginal discharge.
The doctor will usually take swabs from inside your vagina and cervix. These will be sent to a lab for analysis. However, a swab test can’t be relied on to diagnose PID, as some women with PID have a negative swab result.
You may have an ultrasound scan. Scans can identify severe PID but will not show up mild disease. It’s possible to have a normal scan and still have PID.
If it’s diagnosed at an early stage, oral antibiotics will treat PID. You’ll probably be given these to take for at least 2 weeks.
In more severe cases, you may be admitted to hospital for observation and treatment with antibiotic injections.
Always see your doctor or nurse if you think you might have PID, as the sooner you are treated, the better. If you’re given treatment, always make sure that you take all of your antibiotics and finish the entire course.
Your partner(s) should also be treated and you should avoid sex until your treatment is completed.
Most cases of PID are caused by a bacterial infection that’s spread from the vagina or the cervix to the reproductive organs higher up.
Many different types of bacteria can cause PID. However, most cases are the result of a chlamydia or gonorrhoea infection.
In some cases, the cause of the infection that leads to PID is unknown. Such cases may be the result of normally harmless bacteria found in the vagina. These bacteria can sometimes get past the cervix and into the reproductive organs.
If left untreated, PID can cause serious conditions including:

pelvic abscesses
long-term pelvic pain, or pelvic pain that keeps coming back
reduced fertility or infertility
ectopic pregnancy

The best way to reduce your risk of STIs is to practice safer sex. This means using a condom for vaginal, anal and oral sex.
If you have been diagnosed with PID you should get tested for all STIs including:

chlamydia
gonorrhoea
syphilis
"
Pelvic organ prolapse,"Some women with a pelvic organ prolapse don’t have any symptoms at all. The condition may only discovered during an internal examination for another reason. For example, during a cervical screening test (smear test). Other women will experience symptoms. It’s normal for your symptoms to feel more or less severe at different times of the day.
A prolapse is a common condition. Seeing your doctor earlier may help you manage it more easily.
Your doctor will need to carry out a pelvic examination, which will include an internal examination of your vagina. Your doctor will discuss this with you and you can ask any questions that you might have.
As this is an intimate examination, the doctor may have another person (chaperone) present. You can ask for a female doctor or health professional if you prefer.
The internal examination is similar to a smear test and should only take a few minutes. Your doctor will discuss with you if they think any further tests are needed.
Pelvic organ prolapse can affect the front, top or back of vagina. The main types of prolapse are:

anterior prolapse (cystocele) – where the bladder bulges into the front wall of the vagina
prolapse of the womb and / or cervix (the opening between the vagina and the womb) – where the womb and / or cervix bulges down in to the vagina
‘vault’ prolapse – this can be as a result of a total hysterectomy where the new ‘top’ of the vagina bulges downwards
posterior wall prolapse (rectocoele or enterocoele) – when the bowel bulges forward into the back wall of the vagina

You can have more than one of these types of prolapse at the same time.
A number system of 1 to 4 is usually used to describe how severe a pelvic organ prolapse is. For example, a 4 means a severe prolapse. You can ask your healthcare professional what this means for you, and any other questions you may have."
Penile cancer,
Peripheral neuropathy,"The symptoms of mononeuropathy can vary because they depend on which specific nerve has been affected. Example symptoms could include:

pain, weakness or altered sensation your fingers, feet or shins
double vision or other problems with focusing your eyes, sometimes with eye pain
weakness of one side of your face (Bell’s palsy)
Carpal tunnel syndrome
"
Personality disorder,"For example, borderline personality disorder (one of the most common types) can lead to:

disordered thinking
impulsive behaviour
problems controlling your emotions
concerns that other people will abandon you
intense but unstable relationships

Antisocial personality disorder can cause:

you to get frustrated easily
difficulty controlling anger

Other symptoms can include:

avoiding other people
being overwhelmed with feelings like anxiety or distress
feeling empty and emotionally distressed
difficulty maintaining stable and close relationships with other people
periods of losing contact with reality

Some people with personality disorders may have other mental health problems. For example, depression or drug and alcohol misuse."
PIMS,"All children with PIMS have fever (temperature over 380C) lasting at least 3 to 4 days.
Other common symptoms are:

red rash (spots or blotches) which may be there all the time, or come and go
red eyes (conjunctivitis) which are not sticky or itchy
abdominal pain which might be severe, like appendicitis
vomiting and/or diarrhoea
sore throat, cough, breathlessness
swollen glands
sore red mouth
swollen hands and feet
headache
dizziness
sleepiness or confusion

Many other illnesses can cause the same symptoms as PIMS. There’s no specific test for PIMS. Doctors can diagnose PIMS by:

asking about symptoms and how they’ve progressed
examination
doing blood tests and scans which show signs of inflammation

Although PIMS can make children very sick, there is effective treatment. The vast majority of children make a full recovery.
The most common medicines used are steroids and immunoglobulin. These are given into the vein and reduce inflammation. PIMS can affect the way the heart works, and cause inflammation in other organs. Some children will also need other treatments to help the heart and other body systems."
Plantar heel pain,
Pleurisy,
Pneumonia,
Polio,"About 95% of people with polio won’t have any symptoms and will fight off the infection without even realising they were infected.
A small number of people will experience a flu-like illness 3 to 21 days after they’re infected.
Symptoms can include:

a high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above
a sore throat
a headache
abdominal (tummy) pain
aching muscles
feeling and being sick

These symptoms will usually pass within about a week.
In less than 1% of cases, the polio virus attacks the nerves in the spine and base of the brain. This can cause paralysis, usually in the legs, that develops over hours or days.
The paralysis isn’t usually permanent, and movement will often slowly return over the next few weeks and months.
But some people are left with persistent problems. If the breathing muscles are affected, it can be life threatening.
Although polio often passes quickly without causing any other problems, it can sometimes lead to persistent or lifelong difficulties.
About 1 in every 200 people with the infection will have some degree of permanent paralysis, and others may be left with problems that require long-term treatment and support.
These can include:

muscle weakness
shrinking of the muscles (atrophy)
tight joints (contractures)
deformities, such as twisted feet or legs

There’s also a chance that someone who’s had polio in the past will develop similar symptoms again, or worsening of their existing symptoms, many decades later. This is known as post-polio syndrome.
You can become infected with the polio virus if you come into contact with the poo (faeces) of someone with the infection, or with the droplets launched into the air when they cough or sneeze.
You can also get the infection from food or water that’s been contaminated with infected poo or droplets.
If the virus gets into your mouth, it travels to your throat and bowels, where it starts to multiply. In some cases, it can also get into the bloodstream and spread to the nervous system.
The virus can be spread by someone with the infection from about a week before any symptoms develop, until several weeks afterwards. Infected people who don’t have any symptoms can still pass polio on to others.
There have been rare cases where polio has been caused by being vaccinated with a live version of the polio virus.
This is no longer a risk in the UK because the vaccine used nowadays contains an inactive version of the virus.
As a result of routine vaccination programmes, polio has been largely wiped out in most parts of the world.
Areas declared polio-free by the World Health Organization (WHO) include Europe, the Americas, the western Pacific region and, most recently, southeast Asia.
But polio is found in some places. It’s still a significant problem in Afghanistan, Nigeria and Pakistan, and there’s a potential risk of infection in other parts of Africa and some Middle Eastern countries.
There’s currently no cure for polio. Treatment focuses on supporting bodily functions and reducing the risk of long-term problems while the body fights off the infection.
This can include bed rest in hospital, painkillers, breathing support and regular stretches or exercises to prevent problems with the muscles and joints.
If you’re left with long-term problems as a result of a polio infection, you’ll probably need ongoing treatment and support.
This may include physiotherapy to help with any movement problems, devices such as splints and braces to support weak limbs or joints, occupational therapy to help you adapt to any difficulties, and possibly surgery to correct any deformities.
The polio vaccine is offered as part of the NHS routine childhood immunisation programme.
It’s given in 5 separate doses:

at 8, 12 and 16 weeks of age – as part of the 6-in-1 (DTaP/IPV/Hib/HepB) vaccine
at 3 years and 4 months of age – as part of the 4-in-1 (DTaP/IPV) pre-school booster
between 13 and 18 years of age – as part of the 3-in-1 (Td/IPV) teenage booster

If you’re planning to travel to a polio-affected country, you should get immunised if you’ve not been fully immunised before, or have a booster dose if it’s been 10 years or more since your last dose of the vaccine.
Read more about travel immunisations
You can also get immunised at any point if you haven’t been fully immunised before, even if you’re not travelling somewhere where there’s a risk of infection.
If you’ve had polio in the past and haven’t been immunised, it’s still recommended that you get fully immunised.
There are 3 types of polio virus that the vaccine protects against, and people who have had the infection before will only be immune to one of these.
The polio immunisation is routinely offered for free on the NHS.
As the result of an increase in worldwide cases of polio in early 2014, the WHO issued temporary additional travel recommendations for people visiting countries where polio is found.
Depending on where you intend to travel, what you’ll be doing there and how long you’re staying for, you may now be advised to have a booster polio immunisation before travelling if you haven’t had one in the past 12 months.
Some of the countries where there’s risk of infection will require proof of immunisation before you’re permitted to travel elsewhere. If you don’t have this, you may be given a booster dose before departing."
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS),"You are born with PCOS, but symptoms often start during puberty although for some people this can be later, up to their early twenties.
There are lots of different symptoms that can be caused by PCOS. The main symptoms are:

irregular periods – you should have at least 3 or 4 periods a year to keep the womb healthy if you’re not using hormonal contraception
excess facial or body hair which is caused by slightly higher levels of ‘male’ hormones in your body (androgen)

Other symptoms can include:

weight gain
hair loss or hair thinning
oily skin or acne
difficulty or delays getting pregnant

People who have PCOS can also struggle with depression and with their mental health as a result of the condition.
PCOS can increase your risk of certain health conditions, including type 2 diabetes and high cholesterol.
You should speak to your doctor if you are experiencing these symptoms and you are not pregnant or on hormone treatment."
Polymyalgia rheumatica,"Polymyalgia rheumatica often causes pain and stiffness. This can affect the shoulders, neck and hips. These symptoms can develop quickly over a few days or weeks. Both sides of the body are usually affected.
The stiffness often feels worse first thing in the morning after you wake up. It usually starts to improve after about 45 minutes as you become more active.
Polymyalgia rheumatica may also cause:

high temperature (fever) and sweating
extreme tiredness (fatigue)
loss of appetite
weight loss
depression

If you have been diagnosed with polymyalgia rheumatica and you suddenly develop vision loss or changes in your vision, like double vision, contact an optician immediately or phone 111.
It can take a long time to diagnose polymyalgia rheumatica. You may need different tests to help diagnose it. This is because it shares symptoms with other health conditions that need to be ruled out first.
There’s no specific test for polymyalgia rheumatic. But you should have blood tests to look for things like signs of inflammation before starting any corticosteroid treatment.
An X-ray or ultrasound scan may also be used to look at the condition of your bones and joints."
Post-polio syndrome,"The symptoms of post-polio syndrome include:

muscle weakness
shrinking of the muscles (atrophy)
tight joints (contractures)
pain in muscles or joints
chronic fatigue including physical tiredness and brain fatigue
swallowing and speech problems
respiratory problems like breathlessness and sleep apnoea
cramps and muscle twitching
being sensitive to cold temperatures

The muscle weakness and atrophy usually affects muscles that were previously affected by polio. Sometimes it affects other muscles.
This can impact your mobility and your ability to do everyday tasks like brushing your teeth or drying your hair.
Chronic fatigue is one of the most common and troublesome symptoms of post-polio syndrome. This can be physical fatigue (tiredness) and brain fatigue. Brain fatigue can cause problems with concentration, attention and memory. MRI scans can show white spots in the brains of polio survivors which may be related to brain fatigue.
The symptoms can gradually get worse over many years. There are supportive treatments that can help with symptoms.
Although post-polio syndrome is rarely life threatening, some people can develop breathing and swallowing difficulties that can lead to serious problems like chest infections.
Some people experience a sensitivity to some types of anaesthesia causing them to take longer to recover from having anaesthesia."
Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD),"The symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can have a significant impact on your day-to-day life.
In most cases, the symptoms develop during the first month after a traumatic event. However, in a minority of cases, there may be a delay of months or even years before symptoms start to appear.
Some people with PTSD experience long periods when their symptoms are less noticeable, followed by periods where they get worse. Other people have constant, severe symptoms.
The specific symptoms of PTSD can vary widely between individuals, but generally fall into the categories described below.
Re-experiencing is the most typical symptom of PTSD. This is when a person involuntarily and vividly re-lives the traumatic event in the form of:

flashbacks
nightmares
repetitive and distressing images or sensations
physical sensations – such as pain, sweating, nausea or trembling

Some people have constant negative thoughts about their experience, repeatedly asking themselves questions that prevent them from coming to terms with the event.
For example, they may wonder why the event happened to them and if they could have done anything to stop it, which can lead to feelings of guilt or shame.
Trying to avoid being reminded of the traumatic event is another key symptom of PTSD. This usually means avoiding certain people or places that remind you of the trauma, or avoiding talking to anyone about your experience.
Many people with PTSD try to push memories of the event out of their mind, often distracting themselves with work or hobbies.
Some people attempt to deal with their feelings by trying not to feel anything at all. This is known as emotional numbing. This can lead to the person becoming isolated and withdrawn, and they may also give up pursuing activities they used to enjoy.
Someone with PTSD may be very anxious and find it difficult to relax. They may be constantly aware of threats and easily startled. This state of mind is known as hyperarousal.
Hyperarousal often leads to:

irritability
angry outbursts
sleeping problems (insomnia)
difficulty concentrating

Many people with PTSD also have a number of other problems, including:

other mental health problems – such as depression, anxiety or phobias
self-harming or destructive behaviour – such as drug misuse or alcohol misuse
other physical symptoms – such as headaches, dizziness, chest pains and stomach aches

PTSD sometimes leads to work-related problems and the breakdown of relationships.
PTSD can affect children as well as adults. Children with PTSD can have similar symptoms to adults, such as having trouble sleeping and upsetting nightmares.
Like adults, children with PTSD may also lose interest in activities they used to enjoy and may have physical symptoms such as headaches and stomach aches.
However, there are some symptoms that are more specific to children with PTSD, such as:

bedwetting
being unusually anxious about being separated from a parent or other adult
re-enacting the traumatic event(s) through their play

It’s normal to experience upsetting and confusing thoughts after a traumatic event, but in most people these improve naturally over a few weeks.
You should visit your GP if you or your child are still having problems about four weeks after the traumatic experience, or if the symptoms are particularly troublesome.
Your GP will want to discuss your symptoms with you in as much detail as possible. They’ll ask whether you’ve experienced a traumatic event in the recent or distant past and whether you’ve re-experienced the event through flashbacks or nightmares.
Your GP can refer you to mental health specialists if they feel you’d benefit from treatment. See treating PTSD for more information."
Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (PoTS),
Postnatal depression,"Postnatal depression affects everyone differently. It can start at any point in the first year after giving birth. It can continue from depression in pregnancy. It may develop suddenly or gradually.
Many people feel a bit down, tearful or anxious in the first week after giving birth. This is often called the ‘baby blues’ and is so common that it’s considered normal. The baby blues don’t last for more than 2 weeks after giving birth.
If your symptoms last longer or start later, you could have postnatal depression.
The main symptoms of postnatal depression include:

a persistent feeling of sadness and low mood
loss of interest in the world around you
no longer enjoying things that used to give you pleasure
lack of energy and feeling tired all the time
trouble sleeping at night
feeling sleepy during the day
feeling that you’re unable to look after your baby
problems concentrating and making decisions
loss of appetite or an increased appetite (comfort eating)
feeling agitated, irritable or very apathetic (you ‘can’t be bothered’)
feelings of guilt, hopelessness and self-blame
difficulty bonding with your baby – feeling of indifference and no sense of enjoyment in their company
frightening thoughts, for example, about hurting your baby – these can be scary, but they’re very rarely acted upon
thinking about suicide and self-harm

These symptoms can affect your day-to-day life and your relationships with your baby, family and friends.
Postnatal depression can develop gradually and it can be hard to recognise. Some parents may avoid talking to family and friends about how they’re feeling. This may be because they worry they’ll be judged for not coping or not appearing happy.
Signs for partners, family and friends to look out for in new parents include:

frequently crying for no obvious reason
having difficulty bonding with their baby
getting no pleasure from playing with them or feeling no good as a parent
withdrawing from contact with other people
speaking negatively all the time and claiming that they’re hopeless
neglecting themselves, like not washing or changing their clothes
losing all sense of time, like being unaware whether 10 minutes or 2 hours have passed
losing their sense of humour
constantly worrying that something is wrong with their baby, regardless of reassurance from others

If you think someone you know is depressed, encourage them to talk about their feelings. This could be to talk to you, a friend, their GP or their health visitor."
Pregnancy and baby,
Pressure ulcers,"The parts of the body most at risk of developing pressure ulcers are those that are not covered by a large amount of body fat and are in direct contact with a supporting surface, such as a bed or a wheelchair.
For example, if you are unable to get out of bed, you are at risk of developing pressure ulcers on your:

shoulders or shoulder blades
elbows
back of your head
rims of your ears
knees, ankles, heels or toes
spine
tail bone (the small bone at the bottom of your spine)

If you are a wheelchair user, you are at risk of developing pressure ulcers on:

your buttocks
the back of your arms and legs
the back of your hip bone

Healthcare professionals use several grading systems to describe the severity of pressure ulcers. The most common is the European Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel (EPUAP) grading system. The higher the grade, the more severe the injury to the skin and underlying tissue. 
A grade 1 pressure ulcer is the most superficial type of ulcer. The affected area of skin appears discoloured – it is red in white people, and purple or blue in people with darker-coloured skin. Grade 1 pressure ulcers do not turn white when pressure is placed on them. The skin remains intact, but it may hurt or itch. It may also feel either warm and spongy, or hard.
In grade 2 pressure ulcers, some of the outer surface of the skin (the epidermis) or the deeper layer of skin (the dermis) is damaged, leading to skin loss. The ulcer looks like an open wound or a blister.
In grade 3 pressure ulcers, skin loss occurs throughout the entire thickness of the skin. The underlying tissue is also damaged, although the underlying muscle and bone are not. The ulcer appears as a deep, cavity-like wound.
A grade 4 pressure ulcer is the most severe type of pressure ulcer. The skin is severely damaged and the surrounding tissue begins to die (tissue necrosis). The underlying muscles or bone may also be damaged.
People with grade 4 pressure ulcers have a high risk of developing a life-threatening infection. "
Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP),PSP usually develops gradually and can sometimes be mistaken for other conditions. The symptoms tend to get worse over many years.
Prostate cancer,"Prostate cancer does not normally cause symptoms until the cancer has grown large enough to put pressure on the urethra.
This normally results in problems associated with urination. Symptoms can include:

needing to urinate more frequently, often during the night
needing to rush to the toilet
difficulty in starting to pee (hesitancy)
straining or taking a long time while urinating
weak flow
feeling that your bladder has not emptied fully

Your prostate may get larger as you get older due to a non-cancerous condition known as prostate enlargement or benign prostatic hyperplasia.
Symptoms that the cancer may have spread include bone and back pain, a loss of appetite, pain in the testicles and unexplained weight loss.

"
Psoriasis,"Psoriasis typically causes patches of skin that are dry, red and covered in silver scales. Some people find their psoriasis causes itching or soreness.
There are several different types of psoriasis. Many people have only one form of psoriasis at a time, although 2 different types can occur together. One type may change into another type, or become more severe.
Most cases of psoriasis go through cycles, causing problems for a few weeks or months before easing or stopping.
You should see your GP if you think you may have psoriasis.
This is the most common form, accounting for about 80% of cases. Its symptoms are dry, red skin lesions, known as plaques, which are covered in silver scales. They normally appear on your elbows, knees, scalp and lower back, but can appear anywhere on your body. The plaques can be itchy, sore or both. In severe cases, the skin around your joints may crack and bleed. 
This can occur on parts of your scalp or on the whole scalp. It causes red patches of skin covered in thick silvery-white scales. Some people find scalp psoriasis extremely itchy, while others have no discomfort. In extreme cases it can cause hair loss, although this is usually only temporary.
In about half of all people with psoriasis, the condition affects the nails. Psoriasis can cause your nails to develop tiny dents or pits, become discoloured, or grow abnormally. Nails can often become loose and separate from your nail bed. In severe cases, your nails may crumble.
Guttate psoriasis causes small (less than 1cm or 1/3 inch) drop-shaped sores on your chest, arms, legs and scalp. There’s a good chance that guttate psoriasis will disappear completely after a few weeks, but some people go on to develop plaque psoriasis.
This type of psoriasis sometimes occurs after a streptococcal throat infection and is more common among children and teenagers.
This affects folds or creases in your skin, such as the armpits, groin, between the buttocks and under the breasts. It can cause large, smooth red patches in some or all of these areas. Inverse psoriasis is made worse by friction and sweating, so it can be particularly uncomfortable in hot weather.
Pustular psoriasis is a rarer type of psoriasis that causes pus-filled blisters (pustules) to appear on your skin. Different types of pustular psoriasis affect different parts of the body.
This causes pustules on a wide area of skin, which develop very quickly. The pus consists of white blood cells and is not a sign of infection. The pustules may reappear every few days or weeks in cycles. During the start of these cycles, von Zumbusch psoriasis can cause fever, chills, weight loss and fatigue.
This causes pustules to appear on the palms of your hands and the soles of your feet. The pustules gradually develop into circular brown, scaly spots, which then peel off. Pustules may reappear every few days or weeks.
This causes pustules to appear on your fingers and toes. The pustules then burst, leaving bright red areas that may ooze or become scaly. These may lead to painful nail deformities.
Erythrodermic psoriasis is a rare form of psoriasis that affects nearly all the skin on the body. This can cause intense itching or burning. Erythrodermic psoriasis can cause your body to lose proteins and fluid, leading to further problems such as infection, dehydration, heart failure, hypothermia and malnutrition."
Psoriatic arthritis,"Psoriatic arthritis can affect any joint in the body. It causes pain, swelling and stiffness in the joints. It often affects particular areas including the:

hands
feet
knees
elbows
neck and spine

Psoriatic arthritis can also affect the area where tendons and ligaments are connected to the bone. This is called entheses or enthesitis when inflamed.
Sometimes, the whole finger or toe can get inflamed and look sausage-like. This is called dactylitis
Symptoms usually develop slowly. This means that many people don’t know they’re developing psoriatic arthritis. In rare cases, symptoms can develop suddenly without warning.
The severity of psoriatic arthritis varies. Some people may have severe problems affecting many joints. Others may only notice mild symptoms in 1 or 2 joints.
There may be times when your symptoms get better and worse. These are called flare-ups or relapses. Some people may reach a point where they have no symptoms at all (known as remission).
Relapses can be hard to predict. But they can be managed with medication.
You should have check-ups at least once a year if you have been diagnosed with psoriatic arthritis. Make sure you let your doctor know if you’re experiencing any problems with your joints.
If your doctor thinks you may have psoriatic arthritis, they should refer you to a rheumatologist for an assessment. A rheumatologist is a specialist in joint conditions.
If you have psoriasis and problems with your joints, a rheumatologist should be able to diagnose psoriatic arthritis. Other types of arthritis, like rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis, would need to be ruled out first.
You may get some tests to help confirm a diagnosis, including:

blood tests to check for signs of inflammation and other types of arthritis
X-rays of your joints
scans of your joints

The main aims of treatment will be to:

help your symptoms
slow the progression of the condition
improve your quality of life

You may be prescribed medication to help treat psoriatic arthritis. For example:

non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
steroid medications
disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs)

Some people may be prescribed other medications to block chemicals that activate the immune system. These are known as biological medications. But, you will usually be given DMARDs to try first.
For most people, this will mean trying many different medications. Some of these can also treat psoriasis.
As with psoriasis and other types of inflammatory arthritis, you may be more likely to get some other conditions (such as cardiovascular disease (CVD)) if you have psoriatic arthritis.
CVD is the term for conditions of the heart or blood vessels, such as heart disease and stroke.
Your GP should carry out tests each year (such as blood pressure and cholesterol tests) so they can check whether you have CVD. They may offer additional treatment, if necessary.
Psoriatic arthritis can also cause inflammation of the eyes, such as Conjunctivitis and Iritis.
If psoriatic arthritis affects your skin and joints, you may notice changes in your nails such as:

dents
pits
discolouration
loosening from the nail bed

This is less common if only your skin is affected.
As well as your GP and a rheumatologist, you may also be cared for by:

a specialist nurse – often your first point of contact with your specialist care team
a dermatologist (skin specialist) – responsible for treating psoriasis symptoms
a physiotherapist – can create an exercise plan to keep your joints mobile
an occupational therapist – can help you overcome difficulties in your everyday life
a psychologist – can offer psychological support if you need it
a podiatrist – can offer assessment and advice on foot problems

Psoriatic arthritis is a long-term condition. When it affects many joints, regular treatment will likely be needed to keep the disease under control.
An early diagnosis and the right treatment can slow down the progression of psoriatic arthritis. Treatment can also help reduce or prevent permanent damage to your joints.
In some patients with severe disease, the joints may become permanently damaged or deformed, requiring surgical treatment.
You can also help yourself by:

having a good balance between rest and regular physical activity
losing weight, if you’re overweight
not smoking
only drinking moderate amounts of alcohol

Losing weight will help your general health and reduce the strain on your joints. There is evidence that weight loss can also improve the control of psoriatic arthritis and the response to treatment.
Read more about how to lose weight safely
Several studies have shown that patients with psoriatic arthritis who don’t smoke tend to have less severe disease and respond much better to treatment compared to those who do smoke.

Psychosis,
Pubic lice,"It can take up to 3 weeks after coming into contact with pubic lice before you notice any symptoms.
The most common symptom of pubic lice is itchy red spots. The itching is caused by an allergy to the lice saliva or poo.
It can take 1 to 3 weeks for itching to develop after the first infestation, and it’ll usually be worse at night.
Public lice are very small (2mm long) and grey-brown in colour.
They’re hard to spot, but sometimes you may be able to see them in your hair. They live mostly on pubic hair, but can also be found in hair on the chest, armpits, face and eyelashes. They do not affect hair on your head.
You may also notice the following symptoms:

small red or blue spots on your skin (lice bites)
white or yellow dots attached to your hair (lice eggs)
dark red or brown spots in your underwear (lice poo)
crusty or sticky eyelashes, if they’re infected

If you think you might have pubic lice, get checked for free by:

booking an appointment at your local sexual health service
contacting your GP practice for an appointment

There is no test for pubic lice. Your doctor or nurse will check your hair for lice. They may check your pubic hair around your penis or vagina and any other areas that could be affected.
To help spot any pubic lice, your doctor or nurse may use a comb and a magnifying lens.
You can also buy treatment over the counter at your local pharmacy although they will not be able to diagnose the infestation.
Pubic lice are treated with medicated creams or shampoos that kill the lice.
You’ll usually need to use treatment on your whole body and leave it on for a few hours before washing it off. You’ll need to repeat this a week later to make sure all the lice have been killed.
You may be asked to come back to your GP practice or sexual health clinic once you’ve finished treatment to check the treatment has worked.
Your partner(s) should also be treated, even if they do not have symptoms.
Some pubic lice can be resistant to treatment. Resistance means that the lice will not be affected by a particular treatment. If your symptoms don’t settle, you may need to try more than one type of treatment.
Speak to your GP practice or local sexual health clinic if your first treatment hasn’t worked.
Treatment of lice in the eye area is usually different from elsewhere. Certain creams and lotions are not safe for use near the eye area. Lice here can be removed with tweezers or Vaseline can be used to suffocate the lice before removal.
While you’re being treated for pubic lice, there are some things you can do to help stop the lice from spreading.
Pubic lice are spread through close body contact with someone who has them, most commonly sexual contact.
The lice crawl from hair to hair but can’t fly or jump. They need human blood to survive, so generally only leave the body to move from one person to another.
Pubic lice don’t live on other animals such as cats or dogs.
If you or your partner has pubic lice, you should avoid having sex (vaginal, anal or oral). You should also avoid close bodily contact. Do this until you’ve both finished treatment, including any follow-up treatment.
Pubic lice are easily spread, and condoms don’t protect against them.
To reduce the risk of getting pubic lice, you should limit the number of people you have intimate or sexual contact with.
If you have been diagnosed with pubic lice you should get tested for other STIs including:

gonorrhoea
chlamydia
syphilis
"
Pulmonary hypertension,"Symptoms of pulmonary hypertension include:

shortness of breath
fatigue (extreme tiredness)
dizziness
feeling faint
chest pain (angina)
a racing heartbeat (tachycardia)

People with a particular type known as pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) may not experience any symptoms until their condition is already quite advanced.
Symptoms can become worse when you exercise, which may limit your ability to take part in physical activities. As your condition progresses, you may find it difficult to carry out even everyday activities.
When pulmonary hypertension begins to affect your everyday life, this can have a negative impact on your quality of life and can lead to depression.
If you are feeling low and want to talk to someone, you can contact Breathing Space. 
Untreated pulmonary hypertension can lead to heart failure, which is when your heart muscle is struggling to pump blood around your body. As well as shortness of breath and tiredness, heart failure can also cause:

swelling in the legs, ankles and feet (oedema) 
waking up in the middle of the night gasping for breath (paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea) 
a cough that will not go away 
nausea (feeling sick) 
lack of appetite 
weight loss
confusion or difficulties in concentrating

Rare conditions,
Rare tumours,
Raynaud’s phenomenon,
Reactive arthritis,"Reactive arthritis most often affects the:

joints and tendons – causing pain, stiffness and swelling, often in the knees, feet, toes, hips and ankles
eyes – causing eye pain, redness, sticky discharge, conjunctivitis and sometimes inflammation
urinary system – causing pain when peeing, or discharge from the penis or vagina

Most people will not experience symptoms in all of these areas.
Reactive arthritis can also cause symptoms, including:

feeling unusually tired
a high temperature (fever)
weight loss
mouth ulcers
painless white patches inside your mouth
a rash
thick and crumbly nails
abdominal (tummy) pain
diarrhoea

There’s no single test for reactive arthritis. But, different tests may be used to check for infection and rule out other reasons for your symptoms. This includes:

blood tests
urine tests
genital swabs
X-rays
samples of fluid from a joint or joints
stool sample

Your GP will also want to know about your recent medical history. For example, whether you may have recently had a bowel infection or an STI.
There is no cure for reactive arthritis but the condition is usually temporary.
Symptoms can often be controlled using:

non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
painkillers like ibuprofen

Severe symptoms may need to be manged with disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs).
Antibiotics don’t treat reactive arthritis itself. But, you may be prescribed antibiotics to treat an infection like an STI.
Once your symptoms improve, it’s also helpful to begin some gentle exercise. Focus on strengthening the muscles and improving the range of motion in joints.
Speak to a healthcare professional about exercises for you. You may be referred to a physiotherapist.
STIs are a common cause of reactive arthritis. To help prevent this, you should always use a barrier method of contraception during sex. For example, a condom.

Restless legs syndrome,"Restless legs syndrome typically causes an overwhelming urge to move your legs. It also causes an uncomfortable sensation in your legs, which can affect your arms, chest and face.
This sensation has been described as:

tingling, burning, itching or throbbing
a ‘creepy-crawly’ feeling
feeling like fizzy water is inside the blood vessels in the legs
a painful, cramping sensation in the legs, particularly in the calves

These unpleasant sensations can range from mild to unbearable. They’re usually worse in the evening and during the night. The sensation can often be relieved by moving or rubbing your legs.
Some people experience symptoms occasionally, while others have them every day. You may find it difficult to sit for long periods of time, like on a long train journey.
Up to 80% of people with restless legs syndrome also have periodic limb movements in sleep (PLMS).
If you have PLMS, your leg will jerk or twitch uncontrollably, usually at night while you’re asleep. The movements are brief and repetitive, and usually occur every 10 to 60 seconds.
PLMS can be severe enough to wake up both you and your partner. The involuntary leg movements can also occur when you’re awake and resting.
There are two types of restless leg syndrome:

primary or idiopathic restless legs syndrome
secondary restless legs syndrome

Primary restless legs syndrome makes up the majority of restless leg syndrome cases. In these cases, there’s no obvious cause of the syndrome.
Some researchers think it may be caused by a problem with a part of the brain called the basal ganglia. This part of the brain uses a neurotransmitter (chemical) called dopamine to help control muscle activity and movement. If the cells in your basal ganglia becomes damaged, the amount of dopamine in the brain is reduced. This causes muscle spasms and involuntary movements.
Dopamine levels naturally fall towards the end of the day. This may explain why your symptoms are often worse in the evening and during the night.
Research has also identified specific genes related to restless legs syndrome. This means it can run in families. In these cases, symptoms usually occur before the age of 40.
Secondary restless legs syndrome occurs as a complication of another health condition. It can also be the result of another health-related factor.
You can develop secondary restless legs syndrome if you have:

iron deficiency anaemia
chronic kidney disease
diabetes
Parkinson’s disease
rheumatoid arthritis
an underactive thyroid gland
fibromyalgia

You can also develop secondary restless legs syndrome if you’re pregnant. It’s most common from 27 weeks onwards.
There’s no single test for diagnosing restless legs syndrome.
A diagnosis will be based on your:

symptoms
medical history
family history
physical examination
test results

Your GP should be able to diagnose restless legs syndrome.
You’ll be asked about the pattern of your symptoms to help assess their severity. You may also be referred for blood tests. These will confirm if you have primary or secondary restless leg syndrome.
If your restless legs syndrome is disrupting your sleep, you may be sent for sleep tests. These allow healthcare professionals to see exactly what happens when you’re asleep.
The treatment for restless legs syndrome can depend on:

what type of restless legs syndrome you have
the severity of your symptoms

There are triggers that don’t cause restless legs syndrome, but can make symptoms worse. These include medications like:

some antidepressants
antipsychotics
lithium
calcium channel blockers
some antihistamines
metoclopramide

Other possible triggers include:

smoking
excessive caffeine or alcohol consumption
being overweight or obese
stress
lack of exercise
"
Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV),"RSV infection often looks like a cold. You may experience:

a runny nose
a decreased appetite
tiredness
a cough
shortness of breath
wheezing
fever
croup
a middle ear infection (otitis media)

You can treat a mild cases of RSV at home, without contacting a healthcare professional.
There’s no specific treatment for RSV.
A mild case of RSV will normally get better on it’s own, and can be treated at home. You can ease symptoms in the same way you would for a cold. This could include:

drinking plenty of fluids
taking over-the-counter pain relief like paracetamol or ibuprofen

Read more about treating a common cold
RSV is spread by droplets from coughs and sneezes. It can live on surfaces or objects for several hours.
Someone with RSV will normally be contagious for 1 to 2 days before RSV symptoms start. Most people are contagious for 3 to 8 days. Some infants and people with weakened immune systems may be contagious for up to 4 weeks.
RSV infection can happen to anyone, but for most it will be a mild infection that is like a cold.
Some groups are more at risk of severe infection. They are:

babies who were born prematurely
children under 2 years of age
people with chronic lung disease or congenital heart disease
people with weakened immune systems
adults over 65 years of age

There are things you can do to help prevent RSV infection.
The RSV vaccination programme helps protect babies and older adults from the RSV virus.
The vaccine will be offered:

to older adults aged 75 to 79
during pregnancy (from 28 weeks onwards)

Retinoblastoma: Children,
Rhabdomyosarcoma,"The most common symptom is a lump or swelling. Other symptoms will depend on the part of the body that’s affected by the rhabdomyosarcoma:

a tumour in the head or neck area can sometimes cause a blockage (obstruction) and discharge from the nose or throat; occasionally, an eye may appear swollen and protruding
a tumour in the abdomen (tummy) can cause pain or discomfort in the abdomen and difficulty going to the toilet (constipation)
a tumour in the bladder may cause symptoms such as blood in the urine and difficulty passing urine (peeing)

Different tests are usually needed to diagnose a rhabdomyosarcoma. Your child may need a small operation to remove a sample from the tumour (a biopsy) so that it can be examined under a microscope. This is usually done under a general anaesthetic.
Tests may be done to check the exact size of the tumour and to find out if it has spread to any other part of the body. These may include:

a chest X-ray to check the lungs
an ultrasound
CT or MRI scans
blood tests and bone marrow

Any tests and investigations that your child needs will be explained to you
The ‘stage’ of a cancer is a term used to describe its size and whether it has spread from where it first started. Knowing the stage helps the doctors decide on the most effective treatment for your child.
The staging system for rhabdomyosarcoma is based on:

where in the body the tumour started
if it is in only one part of the body (localised disease), or if it has spread to another part of the body (metastatic disease).

There are different ways of staging rhabdomyosarcoma, and your child’s specialist doctor will explain more about the system they are using.
Rhabdomyosarcomas are rare tumours and should be treated at specialist centres. Treatment will depend on the size of the tumour, its position in the body and whether it has spread.
The 3 main types of treatment for soft tissue sarcomas are chemotherapy, surgery and radiotherapy. Your child may have a combination of treatments.
Chemotherapy is the use of anti-cancer (cytotoxic) drugs to destroy cancer cells. It can be given:

to shrink the tumour before surgery
after surgery to reduce the risk of rhabdomyosarcoma coming back

The drugs used and the length of treatment depends on the type and stage of the rhabdomyosarcoma.
If it is possible, your child will have an operation to remove all or as much as possible of the tumour, without damaging surrounding tissue or organs. The operation will depend on the size of the tumour and where it is in your body. The surgeon will explain what is involved. Chemotherapy is usually given before surgery to shrink the tumour and make it easier to remove with surgery. If an operation isn’t possible, both chemotherapy and radiotherapy are given.
Radiotherapy treats cancer by using high energy rays, which destroy the cancer cells while doing as little harm as possible to normal cells. It may be given after surgery to the area where the rhabdomyosarcoma started.
The side effects will depend on the treatment being given and the part of the body that is being treated. Your child’s doctor will discuss this with you before treatment starts. Most side effects are short-term (temporary) and gradually disappear once treatment stops.
Chemotherapy may cause side effects such as feeling sick, hair loss, tiredness, and an increased risk of infection. But it can also make your child feel better by relieving any symptoms the tumour is causing.
Radiotherapy can make your child feel tired, and the skin in the area that’s being treated may go red or get darker. Other side effects will depend on the area of the body that is being treated. Your child’s specialist doctor or nurse will explain this.
A small number of children may develop long-term side effects many years after treatment for rhabdomyosarcoma. This depends on the type of treatment your child had. Your child’s doctor or nurse will talk to you about any possible risk of late side effects. Follow-up for children who’ve had cancer includes close monitoring for any signs of any late effects.
Late effects may include a possible reduction in bone growth, infertility, a change in the way the heart and the kidneys work, and a slight increase in the risk of developing another cancer in later life.
Many children have their treatment as part of a clinical research trial. Trials aim to improve our understanding of the best way to treat an illness, usually by comparing the standard treatment with a new or modified version. Specialist doctors carry out trials for children’s cancer. If appropriate, your child’s medical team will talk to you about taking part in a clinical trial, and will answer any questions you have. Written information is provided to help explain things.
Taking part in a research trial is completely voluntary, and you’ll be given plenty of time to decide if it’s right for your child.
Before any trial is allowed to take place, it must be approved by an ethics committee, which protects the interests of the patients taking part. If you decide to take part in a trial, your doctor or a research nurse must discuss the treatment with you so that you understand the trial and what it means for your child to take part. You may decide not to take part, or you can withdraw from a trial at any stage. You will then receive the best standard treatment available.
Sometimes, clinical trials are not available for your child’s tumour. This may be because a recent trial has just finished, or because the tumour is very rare. In these cases, you can expect your doctors and nurses to offer treatment which is agreed to be the most appropriate, using guidelines which have been prepared by experts across the country. The Children’s Cancer and Leukaemia Group (CCLG) is an important organisation which helps to produce these guidelines.
After treatment, the doctors will regularly check your child to be sure that the cancer has not come back and there are no complications. After a while, you will not need to visit the clinic so often.
If you have specific concerns about your child’s condition and treatment, it’s best to discuss them with your child’s doctor, who knows their situation in detail.
As a parent, the fact that your child has cancer is one of the worst situations you can be faced with. You may have many emotions, such as fear, guilt, sadness, anger and uncertainty. These are all normal reactions and are part of the process that many parents go through at such a difficult time. It’s not possible to address here all of the feelings you may have. However, the CCLG booklet Children & Young People’s Cancer; A Parent’s Guide talks about the emotional impact of caring for a child with cancer and suggests sources of help and support.
Your child may have a variety of powerful emotions throughout their experience with cancer. The Parent’s Guide discusses these further and talks about how you can support your child."
Rheumatoid arthritis,"The symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis vary from person to person. They can come and go, and may change over time.
Symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis that affect the joints include:

pain
swelling
stiffness and difficulty moving affected joints
redness
heat around the joints

In some people, firm swellings called rheumatoid nodules also develop under the skin around affected joints.
Some people with rheumatoid arthritis can experience other symptoms. This includes:

tiredness and lack of energy
a high temperature (fever)
sweating
a poor appetite
weight loss

Rheumatoid arthritis can be difficult to diagnose. This is because many conditions cause joint stiffness and inflammation.
You should speak to your GP if you think you have symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. They will ask about your symptoms and carry out a physical examination to:

check your joints for any swelling
look at how easily your joints move

You GP may also arrange blood tests.
If your GP thinks that you have rheumatoid arthritis, they will refer you to a specialist (Rheumatologist). The Rheumatologist will arrange to meet you to go over your history and examine your joints. They may need to arrange extra tests, like more blood tests or scans, before they can make a diagnosis and decide if treatment is needed. These will:

check for joint inflammation and damage
show what kind of arthritis you have

There’s no cure for rheumatoid arthritis but with treatment the joint pain, swelling and stiffness will improve and the risk of joint damage can be reduced.
Different types of medications can be used to treat rheumatoid arthritis to relieve joint pain, stiffness and swelling. This will also reduce the chance of developing joint damage.
The two main types of medication are:

disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs)
biologic treatments

They usually need to be taken for a long-time. They are most effective when started early after the first symptoms.
You may also need other medication to relieve the joint pain and stiffness.. For example:

painkillers
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
corticosteroids

You may be offered other treatments to help your rheumatoid arthritis symptoms. This includes:

physiotherapy – helps improve muscle strength, flexibility and fitness
occupational therapy – provides training and advice if you need help with everyday tasks or are having difficulty at work
podiatry – helps if you have problems with your feet

If you have rheumatoid arthritis, surgery is sometimes needed to:

improve movement in your joint
reduce pain
correct damage to the shape of the joint

Surgery for rheumatoid arthritis includes:

finger, hand and wrist surgery – there are different types to correct problems in this area
arthroscopy – a procedure to remove inflamed joint tissue
joint replacement surgery – surgery to replace part or all of a joint

Some people with rheumatoid arthritis try complementary therapies like:

massage
acupuncture
osteopathy
chiropractic

Rheumatoid arthritis can be hard to deal with because the symptoms are unpredictable.
Some days the pain and stiffness will be worse than others and there’s no way of knowing when a flare-up will occur. This may mean that some people develop stress, anxiety or depression. It can also cause fear, frustration and anger.
You should speak to a healthcare professional if you’re struggling to deal with your condition.
The National Rheumatoid Arthritis Society (NRAS) website has information about living with rheumatoid arthritits.
You can also phone the National Rheumatoid Arthritis Society (NRAS) helpline on 0800 298 7650. It’s Monday to Friday, 9.30am to 4.30pm. The helpline offers information and emotional support for people with rheumatoid arthritis.
If you’re taking medication for rheumatoid arthritis, tell your healthcare team if you:

want to start a family
are worried about becoming pregnant while on medication

They will make sure your arthritis is controlled whilst you’re trying to get pregnant.
Babies and young children are physically and mentally demanding for any parent. But, rheumatoid arthritis can increase the challenges.
If you’re struggling to cope, you should speak to your health visitor.
Pain, discomfort and changes in the way you feel can affect your sex life. Your self-esteem or thoughts about how you look may also affect your confidence.
Talk to your partner or GP about how rheumatoid arthritis is affecting your sexuality and sexual relationships.
If you have to stop work or work part time because of rheumatoid arthritis, you may find it hard to cope financially.
You may be entitled to financial support like:

Statutory Sick Pay
Employment and Support Allowance
Personal Independence Payment
Attendance Allowance
Carer’s Allowance
Adult Disability Payment

You may also be eligible for other benefits if you have children living at home or if you have a low household income.
Visit the Telecare Self-Check online tool to find the right support for you in your area. This will help you find information on telecare services that could help you live independently at home for longer.
Having rheumatoid arthritis can sometimes lead to other conditions. This includes:

carpal tunnel syndrome – tingling and numbness in your hand and fingers
inflammation in other parts of the body for example in the lungs or around the heart
joint damage and deformity

If you have rheumatoid arthritis, you’re also at a higher risk of:

cardiovascular disease (CVD) – which can cause heart attacks or strokes
cervical myelopathy

The risk of complications developing is lower if rheumatoid arthritis is controlled well.
It’s not clear what triggers rheumatoid arthritis. But, there are some things that could increase the risk of developing it. This includes:

genetics – it may run in families
hormones – it’s more common in women which may be due to the effects of a hormone called oestrogen
smoking
"
Ringworm and other fungal infections,"The symptoms of a tinea fungal infection depend on where the infection is.
The symptoms of ringworm include:

a ring-like red or silvery rash on your skin – your skin will look red and irritated around the ring, but healthy inside
scaly, itchy and inflamed skin

In more severe cases:

the rings may multiply, grow in size and merge together
the rings may feel slightly raised and the skin underneath may be itchy
blisters and pus-filled sores may form around the rings

The ring spreads outwards as it progresses. You can have one patch or several patches of ringworm, and in more serious cases, your skin may become raised and blistered.
Ringworm on the face and neck may not appear ring-shaped, but may be itchy and swollen, and it can become dry and crusted. If you have a beard, you may notice patches of hair breaking away.
Ringworm on the hand often causes the skin to become thicker on the palm and in between the fingers. It may affect one hand or both and normally only appears on one side.
The symptoms of a fungal scalp infection include:

small patches of scaly skin on the scalp, which may be sore
patchy hair loss
an itchy scalp

In more severe cases:

small, pus-filled sores on the scalp
crusting on the scalp
bald patches (if your hair is affected)

In very severe cases, a large inflamed sore called a kerion may form on your scalp. This can ooze pus, and you may also have a fever and swollen lymph glands.
The main symptom of athlete’s foot is an itchy, dry, red and flaky rash, usually in the spaces between your toes. In more severe cases, you may have:

cracked skin in the affected area
blisters, which may ooze or crust
swelling of the skin
a burning or stinging sensation in your skin
scaling patterns around your sole, between your toes and on the side of your foot

The symptoms of jock itch include:

red-brown sores, which may have blisters or pus-filled sores around the edge
itchiness and redness around your groin area, such as your inner thighs and bottom (the genitals are not usually affected)
scaly, flaky skin on your inner thighs

Exercising, walking and wearing tight clothing or underwear can make the symptoms of a groin infection worse.
The symptoms of a fungal nail infection include:

a whitish thickening of the nail
discolouration (the nail can turn white, black, yellow or green)
the nail can become brittle and start to fall off
the skin around the nail may be sore and irritated

Read more about fungal nail infection
Make an appointment to see your GP if you:

or your child develop the symptoms of a fungal scalp infection
have ringworm that has not improved after two weeks of treatment with antifungal cream
have another medical condition, or you’re having medical treatment that is known to weaken your immune system, such as chemotherapy or steroid tablets

Read more about how fungal infections are diagnosed."
Rosacea,"Symptoms often begin with episodes of flushing, where the skin turns red for a short period, but other symptoms can develop as the condition progresses, such as:

burning and stinging sensations
permanent redness
spots (papules and pustules)
small blood vessels in the skin becoming visible

Rosacea is a relapsing condition, which means there are periods when symptoms are particularly bad, but less severe at others.
Read about the symptoms of rosacea
See your GP if you have persistent symptoms that could be caused by rosacea. Early diagnosis and treatment can help stop the condition getting worse.
There’s no specific test for rosacea, but your GP will often be able to diagnose the condition by:

examining your skin
asking about your symptoms
asking about possible triggers you may have

In some circumstances your GP may arrange further tests to rule out other conditions with similar symptoms, such as lupus or the menopause. For example, these could be a blood test or skin biopsy, where a small scraping of skin is removed and examined."
Scabies,"The main symptoms of scabies are intense itching and a rash in areas of the body where the mites have burrowed.
The itching is often worse at night, when your skin is warmer. It may take 4 to 6 weeks before the itching starts because this is how long it takes for the body to react to mite droppings.
Symptoms will start within 1 to 2 days if you’ve had a scabies infection in the past. This is because your immune system will have learned to respond to a scabies infection.
The scabies rash consists of tiny red spots. Scratching the rash may cause crusty sores to develop.
Burrow marks can be found anywhere on the body. They’re short (1cm or less), wavy, silver-coloured lines on the skin, with a black dot at one end that can be seen with a magnifying glass.
In adults, burrow marks often appear in the following areas:

the folds of skin between fingers and toes
the palms of the hands
the soles and sides of the feet 
the wrists
the elbows
around the nipples (in women)
around the genital area (in men) 

The rash usually affects the whole body, apart from the head. The following areas can be particularly affected:

the underarm area
around the waist
the inside of the elbow
the lower buttocks
the lower legs
the soles of the feet
the knees
the shoulder blades
the female genital area
the groin
around the ankles

Elderly people, young children and those with a low immune system (immunocompromised) may also develop a rash on their head and neck.
Men usually have 1 or more very itchy, lumpy, 3 to 10mm spots on the skin of the genitals (on the penis and scrotum). 
In infants and young children, burrow marks tend to appear in different places on their body, including on the:

face
head
neck
scalp
palms of the hands
soles of the feet

Scabies mites leave small red blotches and silver-coloured lines on the skin. These marks are caused by the mites burrowing into the skin.
In infants with scabies, blisters and pustules (small blisters that contain pus) may develop on the soles of the feet and palms of the hands."
Scarlet fever,
Schizophrenia,"Changes in thinking and behaviour are the most obvious signs of schizophrenia, but people can experience symptoms in different ways.
The symptoms of schizophrenia are usually classified into one of two categories – positive or negative.

positive symptoms – represent a change in behaviour or thoughts, such as hallucinations or delusions
negative symptoms – represent a withdrawal or lack of function that you would usually expect to see in a healthy person; for example, people with schizophrenia often appear emotionless, flat and apathetic

The condition may develop slowly. The first signs of schizophrenia, such as becoming socially withdrawn and unresponsive or experiencing changes in sleeping patterns, can be hard to identify. This is because the first symptoms often develop during adolescence and changes can be mistaken for an adolescent “phase”.
People often have episodes of schizophrenia, during which their symptoms are particularly severe, followed by periods where they experience few or no positive symptoms. This is known as acute schizophrenia.
If you are experiencing symptoms of schizophrenia, see your GP as soon as possible. The earlier schizophrenia is treated, the more successful the outcome tends to be.
Read more information about how schizophrenia is diagnosed.
A hallucination is when a person experiences a sensation but there is nothing or nobody there to account for it. It can involve any of the senses, but the most common is hearing voices.
Hallucinations are very real to the person experiencing them, even though people around them cannot hear the voices or experience the sensations.
Research using brain-scanning equipment shows changes in the speech area in the brains of people with schizophrenia when they hear voices. These studies show the experience of hearing voices as a real one, as if the brain mistakes thoughts for real voices.
Some people describe the voices they hear as friendly and pleasant, but more often they are rude, critical, abusive or annoying. The voices might describe activities taking place, discuss the hearer’s thoughts and behaviour, give instructions, or talk directly to the person. Voices may come from different places or one place in particular, such as the television.
A delusion is a belief held with complete conviction, even though it is based on a mistaken, strange or unrealistic view. It may affect the way people behave. Delusions can begin suddenly, or may develop over weeks or months.
Some people develop a delusional idea to explain a hallucination they are having. For example, if they have heard voices describing their actions, they may have a delusion that someone is monitoring their actions.
Someone experiencing a paranoid delusion may believe they are being harassed or persecuted. They may believe they are being chased, followed, watched, plotted against or poisoned, often by a family member or friend.
Some people who experience delusions find different meanings in everyday events or occurrences. They may believe people on TV or in newspaper articles are communicating messages to them alone, or that there are hidden messages in the colours of cars passing on the street.
People experiencing psychosis often have trouble keeping track of their thoughts and conversations. Some people find it hard to concentrate and will drift from one idea to another. They may have trouble reading newspaper articles or watching a TV programme.
People sometimes describe their thoughts as “misty” or “hazy” when this is happening to them. Thoughts and speech may become jumbled or confused, making conversation difficult and hard for other people to understand.
A person’s behaviour may become more disorganised and unpredictable, and their appearance or dress may seem unusual to others. People with schizophrenia may behave inappropriately or become extremely agitated and shout or swear for no reason.
Some people describe their thoughts as being controlled by someone else, that their thoughts are not their own, or that thoughts have been planted in their mind by someone else.
Another recognised feeling is that thoughts are disappearing, as though someone is removing them from their mind. Some people feel their body is being taken over and someone else is directing their movements and actions.
The negative symptoms of schizophrenia can often appear several years before somebody experiences their first acute schizophrenic episode. These initial negative symptoms are often referred to as the prodromal period of schizophrenia.
Symptoms during the prodromal period usually appear gradually and slowly get worse. They include becoming more socially withdrawn and experiencing an increasing lack of care about your appearance and personal hygiene.
It can be difficult to tell whether the symptoms are part of the development of schizophrenia or caused by something else. Negative symptoms experienced by people living with schizophrenia include:

losing interest and motivation in life and activities, including relationships and sex 
lack of concentration, not wanting to leave the house, and changes in sleeping patterns 
being less likely to initiate conversations and feeling uncomfortable with people, or feeling there is nothing to say

The negative symptoms of schizophrenia can often lead to relationship problems with friends and family because they can sometimes be mistaken for deliberate laziness or rudeness."
Sciatica,"Sciatica can have a range of symptoms, these can include:

lower back pain
leg pain, often this feels worse than back pain
a change in sensation in the leg or foot
muscle spasms in the back
a weakness in the leg or foot

A change in feeling in the leg or foot can include:

pins and needles
numbness
hot or cold
burning sensations
shooting sensations
sensations that can be hard to describe

Sciatica can be caused by irritation of the nerves which travel from the spine down the legs.  This can be from inflammation around the nerves and in some cases from pressure, usually from a disc related change. 
Most symptoms of sciatica will improve with time. Nerves are resilient and in most cases inflammation and any disc changes resolve allowing nerves to recover. 
In order for sciatica to be diagnosed you’ll need an assessment from a healthcare professional.
They’ll ask you questions about your back and leg issue and then carry out a physical examination. This may include checking your range of movement and strength.
You may sometimes need to have a further examination to rule out other possible health conditions.
A scan rarely changes how you manage the condition in the early stages. X-ray and MRI is generally not advised in people with sciatica. This is because structural changes of the spine are very common with age and often present in people who have no symptoms. 
A scan can be considered if your symptoms are unchanged for more than 12 weeks, continue to greatly impact your quality of life and you wish to consider surgery. Your healthcare professional can discuss this with you.  
Sciatica usually improves within 12 weeks but this can vary significantly between individuals. For some people symptoms take up to a year to settle but can come and go within this time.
 It’s important to remember, lots of things can influence symptoms such as poor sleep, stress and emotional wellbeing. 
Rarely, sciatica can cause a condition called Cauda equina syndrome to develop.
Cauda equina syndrome is a rare but serious back condition which can lead to permanent damage or disability. If you develop this condition you’ll need to be seen by an emergency specialist spinal team.
Most people will recover from sciatica with a combination of time, modifying activity, and pacing themselves to allow the nerves to adapt. Pain medication, staying active, and gentle exercise will also help.
The nerve can still be sensitive so it is recommended to build up your tolerance to activities slowly.  The little and often approach to movement is recommended.
There are some things you can do to help manage this condition yourself.
A back problem can sometimes mean you need to take some time off work to help recovery. How long you’re off will depend on the nature of your condition and your role at work.
You do not need to be symptom free before you consider returning to work. Continuing to go to work, or returning to work as soon as is possible for you, will help your recovery. Gradually getting back to your normal daily activities can help to build up your strength and stamina levels.
Following this advice, you should see gradual improvements over time.
You should see the biggest change in your symptoms within the first couple of weeks. Most problems should have improved within 6 weeks.
If your sciatica hasn’t improved within 6 weeks of following this advice, or if your symptoms get worse at any time, talk to a healthcare professional about your symptoms.

When dealing with any health condition it’s important to also look after your mental wellbeing as this can impact your recovery."
Scoliosis,
Seasonal affective disorder (SAD),"The symptoms of seasonal affective disorder (SAD) differ throughout the year and from person to person.
The symptoms of SAD are usually fairly mild at the start of the autumn. They might get worse as the winter progresses and the amount of sunlight decreases. However, the nature and severity of the symptoms of SAD will vary from person to person.
If you have SAD, you may experience depressive symptoms like:

low mood
a loss of pleasure or interest in normal, everyday activities
irritability
feelings of despair
feelings of guilt and worthlessness
low self-esteem
indecisiveness
tearfulness
stress or anxiety
a reduced sex drive

You may also:

be less active than normal
feel tired and sleep more than normal (hypersomnia)
feel lethargic (lack energy)
find it difficult to concentrate
have an increased appetite and eat more than usual (hyperphagia)

For many people, SAD can be a difficult condition to live with because it can have a significant effect on your day-to-day life.
Some people with SAD experience recurring episodes of unipolar depression. This is where you only experience depressive symptoms. Others find they experience mild episodes of bipolar depression. This is when depressed periods are followed by manic periods where you feel happy, energetic and much more sociable.
The exact cause of seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is unknown. The symptoms of depression are thought to be linked to less exposure to sunlight.
One theory is that light stimulates a part of the brain called the hypothalamus. This part controls your mood, sleep and appetite, affecting how you feel.
In people with SAD, lack of sunlight and a problem with certain chemicals in the brain prevents the hypothalamus from working properly. The lack of light is thought to affect:

the production of melatonin – melatonin is a hormone that makes you sleepy; in people with SAD, the body may produce it in higher than normal levels
the production of serotonin – serotonin is a hormone that affects your mood, appetite and sleep; a lack of sunlight may lead to lower serotonin levels, which is linked to feelings of depression

your internal body clock (circadian rhythm) – your body uses sunlight to time important biological functions, like when you wake up, so lower light levels during winter may disrupt your body clock causing SAD
SAD is often difficult to diagnose because the there are many other types of depression that have similar symptoms. It may take several years before you and your GP realise that your symptoms are forming a regular pattern.
Your GP might carry out a psychological assessment to check your mental health. During the assessment, you may be asked questions about:

your mood
your lifestyle
your eating patterns
your sleeping patterns
any seasonal changes in your thoughts and behaviour
whether there is anything in your personal history that may contribute to a depressive disorder, like abuse
whether there is anything in your family history that may contribute to a depressive disorder, like a family history of depression

Your GP may also carry out a brief physical examination to check for any other possible causes of your symptoms.
A diagnosis of SAD will depend on whether:

you’ve had symptoms during the same seasons for 2 or more years in a row
your periods of depression are followed by periods without depression
there are any other obvious explanations or causes for your seasonal mood changes

Your GP will recommend the most suitable treatment option for you. This may involve using a combination of treatments to get the best results.
Treatment options may include:

cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) – a talking therapy. It helps you change how you think and react to situations that are making you unhappy
counselling – another type of talking therapy where you talk to a trained counsellor about your worries and problems
psychodynamic psychotherapy – where you can discuss how you feel about yourself, how you feel about others and experiences in your past

If other treatments like CBT, counselling and psychotherapy aren’t helping, there are some other options that might be offered to you.
Antidepressants are often only prescribed for SAD when the symptoms are severe. This is because there’s limited evidence that they’re effective.
It’s thought that they are most effective if they’re taken at the start of winter (before the symptoms appear) and continued until spring.
It can take between four and six weeks for antidepressants to take full effect. It’s also important to continue to take the medication as prescribed, even if you start to feel better.
Read more about antidepressants
Researchers think that light therapy works by simulating the sunlight that’s missing during the darker winter months.
This additional light encourages your brain to

reduce the production of melatonin (the hormone that makes you sleepy)
increase the production of serotonin (the hormone that affects your mood)

It’s thought that altering the levels of both hormones can help to ease your symptoms of SAD.
However, there’s mixed evidence about the effectiveness of light therapy. It’s difficult to compare the research because they use a variety of light sources. Also, many of the clinical trials (medical tests) were conducted over short periods of time.
The studies which showed that light therapy is effective discovered that it’s best if used first thing in the morning.
Light therapy produces short-term results. It may help to relieve your current symptoms, but you’ll still be affected by SAD next winter."
Sepsis,"In some cases, symptoms of more severe sepsis or septic shock (when your blood pressure drops to a dangerously low level) develop.
These can include:

feeling dizzy or faint
a change in mental state – like confusion or disorientation
diarrhoea
nausea and vomiting
slurred speech
severe muscle pain
severe breathlessness
less urine production than normal – for example, not urinating for a day
cold, clammy and pale or mottled skin
loss of consciousness
"
Septic shock,
Shingles,"The main symptom of shingles is pain, followed by a rash that develops into itchy blisters. These look like chickenpox.
Sometimes shingles causes symptoms that develop a few days before the painful rash. This includes symptoms like:

a headache
burning, tingling, numbness or itchiness of the skin in the affected area
a feeling of being generally unwell
a high temperature (fever)

The shingles rash usually appears on one side of your body. It develops on the area of skin related to the affected nerve.
New blisters can appear for up to a week. A few days after appearing they become yellowish in colour, flatten and dry out.
Scabs then form where the blisters were, which may leave some slight scarring.
Most people with shingles experience a localised band of pain in the affected area.
The pain may be a constant, dull or burning sensation and its intensity can vary from mild to severe. You may have sharp stabbing pains from time to time, and the affected area of skin will usually be tender."
Shortness of breath,
Sickle cell disease,"The main symptoms of sickle cell disease are sickle cell crises (very painful episodes affecting different parts of the body), infections, and anaemia.
There are a number of serious problems that can appear suddenly as a result of sickle cell disease. If you experience any of the following symptoms, you should get medical advice immediately:

high temperature (a fever) going to 38C (100.4F) or higher
difficulty breathing
drowsiness, confusion, or slurred speech
a severe headache, stiff neck, or dizziness
skin or lips that are very pale
fits (seizures)
serious pain that isn’t responding to treatments at home
sudden swelling in the tummy
priapism – a painful erection lasting two hours or more
weakness on one or both sides of your body
sudden vision loss, or changes in your vision

If you develop any of the symptoms listed above, phone your GP or care team immediately. If you can’t contact your GP or care team, go to your closest Accident and Emergency (A&E) department. Dial 999 for an ambulance if you aren’t able to travel yourself.
It’s important to make sure that the medical team looking after you know that you have sickle cell disease.
Episodes of pain known as sickle cell crises happen when the blood vessels that go to one part of your body become blocked. The pain can be severe.
Sickle cell crises are one of the most common symptoms of sickle cell disease and, on average, occur once a year and last up to seven days. Some people have sickle cell crises every few weeks – others experience them less than once a year.
A sickle cell crisis typically affects one part of the body at a time. The most common parts affected are:

hands or feet (this is especially common in young children)
ribs and breastbone
spine
pelvis
tummy
legs and arms

Sickle cell crises have different causes. They can be triggered by cold, rainy or windy weather, stress, dehydration, or exercise that leaves you severely out of breath.
Sickle cell disease leaves people – especially children – extra vulnerable to infection because their bodies aren’t as effective at dealing with bacteria and viruses. This leaves them more vulnerable to viruses like the common cold, as well as severe and potentially life-threatening conditions like meningitis.
As well as keeping up to date with their vaccinations, many people with sickle cell disease take daily doses of antibiotics in order to prevent infections.
Almost everyone with sickle cell disease has anaemia. Haemoglobin is found in red blood cells – it’s the substance that transports oxygen around the body. People with anaemia have low levels of haemoglobin in their blood.
Most of the time anaemia doesn’t cause symptoms, but if you’re infected with parvovirus, the virus that causes slapped cheek syndrome, the anaemia can get worse. When that happens, it causes:

headaches
a fast heartbeat
fainting
dizziness

If these symptoms occur, the anaemia is usually treated with a blood transfusion.
Sudden anaemia can happen in young children if they experience swelling of the spleen. This is also treated with a blood transfusion.
There’s a wide range of other issues that can be caused by sickle cell disease. These include:

a serious lung condition called acute chest syndrome that can cause chest pain, a cough, breathing difficulties and fever
pain in bones and joints
delayed puberty
delayed growth in childhood
kidney or urinary problems, including bedwetting and blood in the urine
gallstones – these are stones in the gallbladder that can cause jaundice (yellow eyes and skin) and abdominal (tummy) pain
ulcers on the lower legs (open sores that can be very painful)
priapism – a painful, persistent erection that can last for several hours
high blood pressure (pulmonary hypertension)
transient ischaemic attacks (TIAs) or strokes – these happen when blood flow to the brain is interrupted or blocked
enlarged spleen – this can cause a fast heartbeat, worsening of anaemia, a swollen tummy, shortness of breath and abdominal pain
vision problems like floaters, worsened night vision, blurred vision, patchy vision and, occasionally, sudden vision loss

These symptoms can be treated – see Treating sickle cell disease for more information.
You can have a blood test any time to find out if you have sickle cell disease, or find out if you’re a carrier who could have a child with the condition.
Sickle cell disease is usually diagnosed during pregnancy – free screening to find out if a baby is at risk of having the condition is offered to every pregnant woman in Scotland.
Even if your family background doesn’t make it likely your child will have sickle cell disease, you can still request a test.
If possible, screening should be done before the tenth week of pregnancy, so that there’s time to think about further tests that can find out if your baby will be born with sickle cell disease.
Newborn babies are screened for sickle cell disease as part of the newborn blood spot test – the heel prick test. There are a few reasons for this:

if a baby’s parents weren’t screened during pregnancy, this test identifies if the child has sickle cell disease
if screening during pregnancy showed that the baby had a high risk of having sickle cell disease, but no more testing was done, the heel prick test will determine if the child has the condition or not
this test shows if the baby is a carrier of sickle cell, and could one day have children of their own who have the condition (find out more about sickle cell carriers here)
the heel prick test identifies other inherited conditions, like cystic fibrosis

Another blood test will be used to confirm the diagnosis if the heel prick test suggests that the baby could have sickle cell disease.
Learn about being tested to see if you carry the sickle cell gene"
Sinusitis,"Sinusitis usually occurs after an infection, such as a cold.
Symptoms of sinusitis include:

a green or yellow discharge from your nose
a blocked nose
pain and tenderness around your cheeks, eyes or forehead
a high temperature (fever) of 38°C (100.4°F) or more
toothache
a reduced sense of smell
bad breath (halitosis)

Children with sinusitis may:

be irritable
breathe through their mouth
have difficulty feeding
sound nasal when they speak, as though they have a stuffy cold

The symptoms of sinusitis often clear up within a few weeks (acute sinusitis). Occasionally they can last 3 months or more (chronic sinusitis).
If your symptoms are mild and getting better, you can often treat sinusitis without seeing a GP.
Your GP will usually be able to diagnose sinusitis from your symptoms and by examining the inside of your nose.
If you keep getting sinusitis, or its severe, they may refer you to an ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist.
Sinusitis usually gets better on its own within 2 or 3 weeks.
Always read the leaflet that comes with your medicine before taking it. Follow the recommended dosage instructions. If you’re not sure which treatments are suitable for you or your child, speak to a pharmacist for advice.
If your symptoms aren’t improving or are getting worse, your GP may prescribe antibiotics tablets or corticosteroid spray or drops.
If your symptoms still don’t get better, you may be referred to an ENT specialist for surgery to improve the drainage of your sinuses.
Sinusitis is usually caused by a cold or flu virus spreading to the sinuses from the upper airways. Only a few cases are caused by bacteria infecting the sinuses.
An infected tooth or fungal infection can also occasionally cause the sinuses to become inflamed.
It’s not clear exactly what causes sinusitis to become chronic (long-lasting), but it may be related to:

allergies and related conditions, including allergic rhinitis, asthma and hay fever
nasal polyps (benign growths inside the nose)
smoking
a weakened immune system

Controlling underlying conditions like allergies may improve the symptoms of chronic sinusitis."
Sjogren’s syndrome,"The most commonly reported symptoms of Sjögren’s syndrome are a dry mouth and eyes, which can lead to other associated symptoms.
However, these symptoms can be common in old age, and most people with dry eyes or a dry mouth do not have Sjögren’s syndrome.
Many women also experience vaginal dryness, which can make sex painful.
A dry mouth can lead to:

tooth decay and gum disease
dry cough
difficulty swallowing and chewing
hoarse voice
difficulty speaking
swollen salivary glands (located between your jaw and ears)
repeated fungal infections in the mouth (oral thrush) – symptoms of which can include a coated or white tongue

Dry eyes can lead to:

burning or stinging eyes
itchy eyes
a feeling that there’s grit in your eyes
irritated and swollen eyelids
sensitivity to light (photophobia)
tired eyes
mucus discharge from your eyes

These symptoms can get worse when you’re:

in a windy or smoky environment
in an air-conditioned building
travelling on aeroplane

In more serious cases of Sjögren’s syndrome, the immune system can attack other parts of the body, causing symptoms and conditions such as:

dry skin
tiredness and fatigue – which are common and can lead to total exhaustion
muscle pain
joint pain, stiffness and swelling
vasculitis (inflammation of blood vessels)
difficulty concentrating, remembering and reasoning
"
Skin cancer (melanoma),"The first sign of a melanoma is often a new mole or a change in the appearance of an existing mole.
Normal moles are usually round or oval, with a smooth edge, and no bigger than 6mm (1/4 inch) in diameter.
Speak to your GP as soon as possible if you notice changes in a mole, freckle or patch of skin, especially if the changes happen over a few weeks or months.
Signs to look out for include a mole that is:

getting bigger
changing shape
changing colour
bleeding or becoming crusty
itchy or painful

A helpful way to tell the difference between a normal mole and a melanoma is the ABCDE checklist:

Asymmetrical – melanomas have 2 very different halves and are an irregular shape
Border – melanomas have a notched or ragged border
Colours – melanomas will be a mix of 2 or more colours
Diameter – melanomas are larger than 6mm (1/4 inch) in diameter.
Enlargement or elevation – a mole that changes size over time is more likely to be a melanoma

Melanomas can appear anywhere on your body, but they most commonly appear on the back, legs, arms and face. They may sometimes develop underneath a nail.
In rare cases, melanoma can develop in the eye. Noticing a dark spot or changes in vision can be signs, although it is more likely to be diagnosed during a routine eye examination.

Cancer Research UK: Melanoma symptoms
"
Skin cancer (non-melanoma),"The main symptom of non-melanoma skin cancer is the appearance of a lump or discoloured patch on the skin that doesn’t heal.
The lump or discoloured patch is the cancer, sometimes referred to as a tumour.
Non-melanoma skin cancer most often appears on areas of skin which are regularly exposed to the sun, such as the face, ears, hands and shoulders.
Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) usually appears as a small red or pink lump, although it can be pearly-white or ‘waxy’ looking. It can also look like a red, scaly patch.
The lump slowly grows and may become crusty, bleed or develop into a painless ulcer.
Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) appears as a firm pink lump and may have a flat, scaly and crusted surface.
The lump is often tender to touch, bleeds easily and may develop into an ulcer.
Bowen’s disease is a very early form of skin cancer, sometimes referred to as ‘squamous cell carcinoma in situ’. It develops slowly and is easily treated. 
The main sign is a red, scaly patch on the skin which may itch. It most commonly affects elderly women and is often found on the lower leg. However, it can appear on any area of the skin.
If you develop a lump, lesion or skin discolouration that hasn’t healed after 4 weeks, speak to your GP. While it is unlikely to be cancer, it is best to be sure.

Skin light sensitivity (photosensitivity),
Skin rashes in children,"Slapped cheek syndrome causes a distinctive bright red rash on both cheeks. This can look alarming, but it usually clears up by itself in 1 to 3 weeks.
Unless your child is feeling unwell, they don’t need to stay away from school. Once the rash appears, the infection is no longer contagious. But, it’s a good idea to notify your child’s school about the infection."
Slapped cheek syndrome,"Symptoms of slapped cheek syndrome usually develop 4 to 14 days after becoming infected. Sometimes, symptoms may not appear for up to 21 days.
Some people with slapped cheek syndrome won’t notice any early symptoms, but most people will have the following symptoms for a few days:

a slightly high temperature (fever) of around 38°C (100.4°F)
a runny nose
a sore throat
a headache
an upset stomach
feeling generally unwell

The infection is most contagious during this initial period.
Adults may also feel joint pain and stiffness. This may continue for several weeks or even months after the other symptoms have passed.
After a few days, a distinctive bright red rash on both cheeks (‘slapped cheeks’) normally appears. Adults may not get this.
By the time this rash develops, the condition is no longer contagious.
After another few days, a light pink rash may also appear on the chest, stomach, arms and thighs. This often has a raised, lace-like appearance and may be itchy.
The rashes will normally fade within a week or two. Occasionally, the body rash may come and go for a few weeks after the infection has passed. This can be triggered by exercise, heat, anxiety or stress.
You don’t usually need to see your GP if you think you or your child has slapped cheek syndrome as it normally gets better on its own.
In these cases, a blood test may be carried out to see if you’re immune to the infection. If you’re not immune, you’ll be monitored carefully to check for any problems.
If you develop severe anaemia, it’s likely that you’ll be sent to hospital for a blood transfusion.
Slapped cheek syndrome is usually mild and should clear up without specific treatment.
If you or your child is feeling unwell, there are things you can do help ease the symptoms.
Slapped cheek syndrome is caused by a virus called parvovirus B19. This is found in the droplets in the coughs and sneezes of someone with the infection.
The virus is spread in a similar way to colds and flu. You can become infected by:

inhaling droplets that are sneezed or coughed out by someone with the infection
touching a contaminated surface or object and then touching your mouth or nose

Someone with slapped cheek syndrome is infectious during the period before the rash develops. Once the rash appears, the condition can no longer be passed on.
It’s very difficult to prevent slapped cheek syndrome. This is because people who have the infection are most contagious before they develop any obvious symptoms.
Make sure that everyone you live with washes their hands often to help stop the infection from spreading.
There’s currently no vaccine available to protect you against the condition."

Stomach cancer,"Many symptoms of stomach cancer are similar to less serious conditions, so it can be difficult to recognise in the early stages.
Early stage symptoms include:

persistent indigestion 
trapped wind and frequent burping
heartburn
feeling full very quickly when eating
feeling bloated after eating
feeling sick
pain in your stomach or breastbone
difficulty swallowing (dysphagia)
vomiting (the vomit may be streaked with blood), although this is uncommon in the early stages

Symptoms of more advanced stomach cancer include:

blood in your stools, or black stools
loss of appetite
weight loss
tiredness
lumpiness and swelling in your stomach (caused by a build-up of fluid)
anaemia (a reduced number of red blood cells that can cause you to feel tired and breathless)
yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice)

Stomach cancer is usually easier to treat if it’s diagnosed early. It’s therefore important for your GP to refer you to a specialist as soon as possible if stomach cancer is suspected.
Stomach cancer is much more common in older people, with 90 out of 100 cases occurring in people who are over 55 years of age.
Indigestion is a very common symptom in the general population. However, it’s unlikely that someone with indigestion who’s under the age of 55 will have stomach cancer.
However, see your GP if you have indigestion and weight loss, anaemia or persistent vomiting. They should refer you to a specialist for further testing.
Also see your GP if you have difficulty swallowing. This isn’t a common symptom among the general population and the cause should always be investigated.

Stomach ulcer,"Although the most common symptom of a stomach ulcer is a burning or gnawing pain in the centre of the abdomen (tummy). Not all stomach ulcers are painful.
Some people experience:

indigestion
heartburn
nausea (feeling sick)

You should speak to your GP if you think you have a stomach ulcer.
More about the symptoms of a stomach ulcer
Speak to your GP immediately (or phone 111) if:

your symptoms persist
you’re vomiting blood – the blood can appear bright red or have a dark brown, grainy appearance like coffee grounds
you’re passing dark, sticky, tar-like stools
you feel a sudden, sharp pain in your tummy that gets steadily worse

These could be a sign of a serious complication.
Stomach ulcers occur when the layer protecting the stomach lining from stomach acid breaks down. This allows the stomach lining to become damaged.
This is usually caused by:

an infection with Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) bacteria
taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen or aspirin – particularly if they’re taken for a long time or at high doses

There’s little evidence that stress or certain foods causes stomach ulcers.
More about the causes of stomach ulcers
You’ll be treated using antibiotics if your ulcer was caused by a H. pylori infection. This kills the bacteria and should prevent the ulcer coming back.
You’ll be treated using a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) if your ulcer was caused by NSAIDs. Your doctor will prescribe these and discuss whether you should keep using NSAIDs. Alternative medication to NSAIDs, such as paracetamol, may be recommended.
Most stomach ulcers take a few months to heal after treatment. However, stomach ulcers can come back after treatment, although this is less likely to happen if the underlying cause is addressed.
More about treating stomach ulcers
Complications are rare but can be very serious and potentially life-threatening.
The main complications include:

bleeding at the site of the ulcer
the stomach lining at the site of the ulcer splits open – known as perforation
the ulcer blocks the movement of food through the digestive system – known as gastric obstruction

Stroke,
Subacromial pain syndrome,"The main symptom is pain in the upper arm caused by specific movements or activities. These are usually activities that involve lifting the arm above shoulder level and reaching behind the back, for example when putting a jacket on.
It may be difficult to lie on the affected shoulder which can disturb your sleep.
In order for subacromial pain syndrome to be diagnosed you’ll need an assessment from a healthcare professional.
They’ll initially ask you questions about your shoulder issue and then carry out a physical examination. This may include checking your range of movement and strength.
You may sometimes need to have a further examination to rule out other possible health conditions.
Treatment options depend on the severity of your symptoms. Although, most cases improve on their own, some cases can take time to resolve.
Your arm may feel really painful but it’s important to keep moving your shoulder. To help manage your pain, break activities you normally do down into smaller amounts.
These should be short term measures to help your pain. As soon as you’re able, try to get back to your normal activities, as this is the best way to help your recovery.
Targeted shoulder exercises to encourage movement, stretching and strengthening exercises can help to improve your arm movement and pain.

Pain medication can help you move more comfortably, which can help your recovery.
More about taking painkillers
Corticosteroid Injections
If painkillers aren’t helping to control the pain, your healthcare professional may discuss the option of having a corticosteroid injection into your shoulder joint.
Corticosteroids are medicines that help reduce pain and inflammation. They may also be given with a local anaesthetic.
Injections won’t cure your condition or reduce shoulder stiffness, they are used to help with the pain.
Read more about corticosteroids 
A shoulder problem can sometimes mean you need to take some time off work to help recovery. How long you’re off will depend on the nature of your condition and your role at work.
You do not need to be symptom free before you consider returning to work. Continuing to go to work, or returning to work as soon as is possible for you, will help your recovery. Gradually getting back to your normal daily activities can help to build up your strength and stamina levels.
Following this advice, you should see gradual improvements over time.
If your symptoms haven’t improved, or it’s got worse, within 6 weeks of following this advice, talk to a healthcare professional about your symptoms.

Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS),
Suicide,
Sunburn,
Supraventricular tachycardia,"If you have supraventricular tachycardia, you’ll usually feel your heart racing in your chest or throat.
The heart rate is usually between 140 to 180 beats per minute but can be as high as 250. A normal heartbeat should be 60 to 100 beats per minute at rest.
During a supraventricular tachycardia, the heart muscle contracts very fast. This means that it cannot relax properly between contractions to fill with blood. This reduces the amount of blood being pumped around the body.
Therefore, you may also feel:

chest pain
dizziness
light-headedness
fatigue (tiredness)
breathlessness

On rare occasions, you may faint because of a drop in blood pressure.
These symptoms vary in length and frequency.
If your doctor thinks that you might have supraventricular tachycardia, you’ll be referred for tests. These can include an:

electrocardiogram (ECG)
ambulatory heart monitor
echocardiogram
"
Swollen glands,
Syphilis,"Most people with syphilis don’t notice any symptoms and don’t know they have it. Symptoms change over time and may come and go.
Syphilis usually has 3 stages.
Ten days to 3 months after infection, you may notice a small, painless sore or ulcer.
This is typically on either the:

penis
vagina
anus
rectum
tongue
lips

You might only have 1 sore, but can have more.
Swelling in your lymph glands (such as in the neck, groin or armpit) often happens with the ulcers.
The sore will then disappear within 2 to 6 weeks. If left untreated, syphilis will move into its second stage.
Symptoms of secondary syphilis begin a few weeks after the original sore disappears.
Common symptoms of secondary syphilis include:

a non-itchy skin rash appearing anywhere on the body, but commonly on the palms of the hands or soles of the feet
tiredness
headaches
swollen lymph glands

Less common symptoms include:

fever
weight loss
patchy hair loss
joint pains

These symptoms may disappear within a few weeks, or come and go for a few months.
Syphilis will then move into a stage where you will experience no symptoms. You’re still infected during this stage. This is called ‘latent syphilis’. You can still pass it on during the first year of this stage. After a couple of years, you can’t pass the infection to others, even though you remain infected. However, during this stage, the infection can be passed on from a mother to an unborn child during pregnancy.
The latent stage can continue for many years (even decades) after you first become infected. Without treatment, there is a risk that latent syphilis will move on to the more serious stage –tertiary syphilis.
The symptoms of tertiary syphilis can begin years or even decades after the initial infection. 1 in 3 people who are not treated for syphilis develop serious symptoms eventually.
The symptoms of tertiary syphilis will depend on what part of the body the infection spreads to. For example, it may affect the brain, nerves, eyes, heart, bones, skin or blood vessels, potentially causing any of the following symptoms:

stroke
dementia
loss of co-ordination
numbness
paralysis
blindness
deafness
heart disease
skin rashes

At this stage, syphilis can be dangerous enough to cause death.
If you think you might have syphilis, get tested for free by:

booking an appointment at your local sexual health service
contacting your GP practice for an appointment

The only reliable way to tell if you have syphilis or not is to have a blood test. This is usually sent to the lab for analysis. However, in some sexual health services, a same day test can be done if you have symptoms.
Antibiotics will treat the syphilis infection, even during pregnancy. These are given by injection, tablets or capsules.
Treatment may be started before your test result is known. You may be given one or more doses, depending on the stage of infection.
You’ll need to go back to your GP practice or sexual health clinic 6 and 12 weeks after starting treatment to be retested.
You should avoid having sex until you and your partner (s) have finished treatment and your tests have shown treatment has worked. This includes oral sex and sex using a condom.
Your partner should also get tested for syphilis. It can be hard to spot in its early stages and they might not realise they have it. They will generally be offered treatment regardless.
In Scotland, pregnant women are tested for syphilis as part of their antenatal checks.
If you’re pregnant and have syphilis, you can pass it on to your baby before they’re born. This is known as congenital syphilis.
Having syphilis during pregnancy can increase the risk of:

miscarriage
premature birth
stillbirth

You can get syphilis by having unprotected vaginal, anal or oral sex (sex without a condom). Around one third of all people who get syphilis do so through having unprotected oral sex with no other vaginal or anal sex involved. It can also be passed by coming into contact with an ulcer on your partners penis, vagina, anus or inside their mouth.
Syphilis can be passed on:

to an unborn baby during pregnancy (congenital syphilis)
by injecting drugs with a needle that’s been used by someone who has syphilis
during a blood or organ transplant (this is extremely rare as all blood and organ donations in the UK are checked for syphilis)

Syphilis also makes HIV easier to pass on and catch.
The number of people getting syphilis in Scotland has greatly increased over the last 5 years. You could be at higher risk if you:

are a man who has sex with men
have had sex overseas
have had multiple sexual partners

The best way to reduce your risk of STIs is to practice safer sex. This means using a condom for vaginal, anal and oral sex.
If you have been diagnosed with syphilis you should get tested for all STIs including:

HIV
chlamydia
gonorrhoea
"
Tennis elbow,"Tennis elbow causes pain and tenderness on the outside of your elbow that may spread down your forearm.
This can cause: 

difficulty with gripping.
difficulty with twisting movements such as opening jars.
restriction in movement at the elbow.
tenderness when touching the area.

Tennis elbow symptoms develop when there’s a problem with the tendons around the elbow.  These tendons help lift your hand backwards.   
Activities that involve the use of these tendons can include:

gripping
writing
lifting
pulling
twisting

Repeated use of the muscles that lift your wrist up can cause changes to the tendon, often due to overloading it. 
Other factors that can affect tendon health include:

smoking 
obesity 
high fat diet  
high cholesterol levels  
diabetes (Type 1 and 2) 

In order for tennis elbow to be diagnosed you’ll need an assessment from a healthcare professional.
They’ll initially ask you questions about your elbow issue and then carry out a physical examination. This may include checking your range of movement and strength.
You may sometimes need to have a further examination to rule out other possible health conditions.
If your elbow pain is aggravated by certain movements try to reduce these by modifying your activity.  
You can modify your activity by:

changing how you grip or lift an object.
reducing the weight you are carrying.
taking regular breaks while doing aggravating activities.

As well as modifying your activities it’s important to start exercising your elbow.

Elbow Support 
Some people find an elbow support, sometimes called an epiclasp, can be helpful to manage the pain caused by tennis elbow.
Research suggests they may be useful in the short term but overall there is limited evidence to support their use.
Corticosteroid Injection 
If exercise, modification of activity and painkillers aren’t helping to control the pain, your healthcare professional may discuss the option of having a corticosteroid injection into your elbow. However, current evidence has shown limited benefit for this type of condition and may be detrimental to the health of your tendon.
Corticosteroids are medicines that help reduce pain and inflammation. They may also be given with a local anaesthetic.
Injections won’t cure your condition, they are used to help with the pain.

Testicular cancer,"The most common symptom of testicular cancer is a lump or swelling in 1 of your testicles.
The lump or swelling can be about the size of a pea, but may be larger.
Most lumps or swellings in the scrotum aren’t in the testicle and aren’t a sign of cancer. But they should never be ignored. Visit your GP as soon as you notice a lump or swelling in your scrotum.
Testicular cancer can also cause other symptoms, including a:

dull ache or sharp pain in your testicles or scrotum, which may come and go
feeling of heaviness in your scrotum
change in the texture or increase in firmness of a testicle
difference between one testicle and the other

Speak to your GP as soon as you notice any lump or swelling on your testicle. They’ll examine your testicles to help determine whether or not the lump is cancerous.
Lumps within the scrotum can have many different causes and testicular cancer is rare. If your GP thinks the lump is in your testicle they may consider cancer as a possible cause.
Research has shown that less than 4% of scrotal lumps or swellings are cancerous. For example, varicoceles (swollen blood vessels) and epididymal cysts (cysts in the tubes around the testicle) are common causes of testicular lumps.
If you do have testicular cancer, the sooner treatment begins, the greater the likelihood that you’ll be completely cured.
If you don’t feel comfortable visiting your GP, you can go to your local sexual health clinic, where a healthcare professional will be able to examine you.
If testicular cancer has spread to other parts of your body, you may also experience other symptoms. Cancer that has spread to other parts of the body is known as metastatic cancer.
Around 5% of people with testicular cancer will experience symptoms of metastatic cancer.
The most common place for testicular cancer to spread to is nearby lymph nodes in your abdomen or lungs. Lymph nodes are glands that make up your immune system. Less commonly, the cancer can spread to your liver, brain or bones.
Symptoms of metastatic testicular cancer can include:

a persistent cough 
coughing or spitting up blood 
shortness of breath

Testicular cancer: Teenagers and young adults,
Testicular lumps and swellings,
Thirst,
Threadworms,"Threadworms often go unnoticed by people who have them.
However, they can cause intense itching around the anus (and the vagina in girls), particularly at night when the female worms are laying eggs. This can disturb sleep.
In some cases, you may spot threadworms on your bed clothes or sheets at night, or you may notice them in your stools. The worms look like threads of white cotton and are about 1cm long."
Thrush,"Some people won’t have any signs or symptoms of thrush at all.
Sometimes there can be too much yeast and it can cause symptoms.
Symptoms of thrush in women include:

white vaginal discharge (often like cottage cheese), which does not usually smell
itching and irritation around the vagina
soreness and stinging during sex or when you pee

Symptoms of thrush in men include:

irritation, burning and redness around the head of the penis and under the foreskin
a white discharge (like cottage cheese)
an unpleasant smell
difficulty pulling back the foreskin

Thrush can affect other areas of skin, including the armpits, groin and between your fingers.
Symptoms of thrush in other areas include:

a red itchy or painful rash (the rash might not be easy to see on darker skin)
white or yellow discharge

If you think you might have thrush, get tested for free by:

contacting your GP practice for an appointment
booking an appointment at your local sexual health service

Testing is also available in some pharmacies.
The test for thrush only takes a few seconds and isn’t usually painful, though it may be uncomfortable for a moment.
It’s not always necessary to have a test for thrush. If you do have a test, a doctor or nurse may:

look at the genital area
use a swab (cotton bud) to collect a sample from the parts of the body that could be affected such as the vagina

Thrush may have similar symptoms to some STIs, so it’s important you seek advice if you think you may be at risk of an STI.
Treatment is simple and only necessary if you have signs and symptoms of thrush.
You may be given:

antifungal cream to apply to the genital area
vaginal pessaries (tablets that you put into your vagina)
oral pills
a combination of treatments

Your doctor or nurse will tell you how to use the treatment.
It’s very important to take the treatment as instructed and finish any course of treatment even if the symptoms go away earlier.
You can buy antifungal treatments from most pharmacies if you’ve been diagnosed with thrush in the past and you know the symptoms.
Some antifungal products can weaken latex condoms, diaphragms and caps. You should avoid sex while undergoing treatment if this is your method of contraception.
You should tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you’re pregnant, might be pregnant, or if you’re breastfeeding. This may affect the type of treatment you’re given.
If thrush isn’t treated it eventually goes away on its own.
There’s no need for your partner(s) to have treatment unless they have signs and symptoms of thrush.
Your chances of developing thrush increase if:

your skin is irritated or damaged
you’re taking antibiotics
you have poorly controlled diabetes
you have a weakened immune system – for example you’re having chemotherapy or living with HIV
you’re having hormone replacement therapy (HRT)
you’re pregnant
you use products that irritate the skin such as perfumed products, bubble baths or vaginal washing products

Some people find that different triggers cause thrush. If you notice a pattern, you may be able to help control it.
There are things you can do to relieve symptoms and stop thrush from coming back.
If you’re prescribed an antibiotic for another condition, remind your doctor that you tend to get thrush and ask for some preventive treatment for thrush at the same time.
Some people may only get thrush once. Others may get it multiple times.
You may need to take treatment for longer if you keep getting thrush (you get it more than 4 times in 12 months).
If you get recurrent thrush the doctor or nurse will want to check that other conditions, such as diabetes, aren’t the cause of the thrush.
They’ll recommend how often you should use treatment."
Thyroid cancer,"In its early stages, thyroid cancer tends to cause no or very few symptoms.
The main symptom of thyroid cancer is a lump or swelling at the front of the neck just below your Adam’s apple, which is usually painless.
Women also have Adam’s apples, but they’re much smaller and less prominent than a man’s.
The lymph nodes in your neck can also be affected and become swollen. Lymph nodes are small glands that are part of the lymphatic system, which helps fight infection.
Other symptoms of thyroid cancer only tend to occur after the condition has reached an advanced stage, and may include:

unexplained hoarseness that doesn’t get better after a few weeks
a sore throat or difficulty swallowing that doesn’t get better
pain in your neck

You should always speak to your GP if you develop a swelling or lump at the front of your neck. Although it’s unlikely to be thyroid cancer, it’s important that it is investigated.
About 1 in 20 swellings or lumps in the neck are caused by thyroid cancer. Most cases are caused by non-cancerous swellings called goitres.
A goitre is an enlarged thyroid gland. Non-cancerous goitres are usually caused by other less serious problems with your thyroid gland, such as:

too much triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) hormones – this is known as having an overactive thyroid gland, or hyperthyroidism
not enough T3 and T4 hormones – this is known as having an underactive thyroid gland, or hypothyroidism

The Butterfly Thyroid Cancer Trust provides information, advice and support for people with thyroid cancer.
As well as the website, they also have a helpline number that can be contacted on 01207 545469, Monday to Friday, 10am to 4pm."
Thyroid cancer: Teenagers and young adults,"The first sign of thyroid cancer is usually a painless lump or swelling in the front of the neck that gradually gets bigger.
Less common symptoms are:

a hoarse voice that doesn’t get better
difficulty swallowing or breathing

If you have any of these symptoms, it’s important to speak to a doctor.
Remember – these symptoms can happen for lots of reasons other than cancer."
Tick bites,"Tick bites aren’t usually painful but they may cause a red lump to develop where you were bitten.
In some cases, tick bites may cause:

swelling
itchiness
blistering
bruising
"
Tinnitus,"Tinnitus is often called ‘ringing in the ears’ but it’s not just ringing. You might hear:

buzzing
humming
grinding
hissing
whistling
music or singing
noises that beat in time with your pulse

You may also notice hearing loss or that you’re more sensitive to everyday sounds.
For some people, tinnitus may come and go. But sometimes it can impact your daily life and be very distressing. It can affect concentration and cause difficulty sleeping (insomnia) and depression.
Tinnitus will sometimes get better over time, either by disappearing or by the body getting used to it.
Your doctor can examine your ears to see if the problem might be caused by a condition they could easily treat, such as an ear infection or earwax build-up. They can also check if you have any hearing loss.
If needed, your GP can refer you to a specialist for further tests and treatment.
Tinnitus can develop slowly over time or happen suddenly.
It’s not known exactly why it happens but it’s often linked to:

hearing loss
inner ear damage caused by repeated exposure to loud noises or some medicines
an earwax build-up
a middle ear infection
Ménière’s disease – a condition that also causes hearing loss and vertigo (a spinning sensation)
otosclerosis – an inherited condition where an abnormal bone growth in the middle ear causes hearing loss

Most people have tinnitus for a short time after being exposed to loud noises, such as after a music concert.
Around 1 in 10 people have persistent tinnitus. Around 1 in 100 having severe tinnitus that affects their daily life.
Tinnitus can affect people of all ages, including children. It’s more common in people aged over 65.
There’s currently no treatment for tinnitus that works for everyone.
If your tinnitus is caused by an underlying condition, then treating that condition may help your tinnitus.
If a cause can’t be found, treatment will focus on helping you manage the condition on a daily basis. This may involve:

sound therapy – listening to neutral sounds to distract you from the sound of tinnitus
counselling – to teach you about tinnitus and help you learn to cope with it better
cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) – to help change the way you think about your tinnitus so it becomes less noticeable
tinnitus retraining therapy (TRT) – to help you start to tune tinnitus out and become less aware of it
"
Tonsillitis,"The symptoms of tonsillitis include:

a sore throat
pain when swallowing
earache
high temperature (fever) over 38°C (100.4°F)
coughing
headache
feeling sick
feeling tired
swollen, painful lymph glands in your neck
white pus-filled spots on the tonsils
bad breath
loss of voice or changes to your voice

Symptoms usually get better within 3 to 4 days.
If needed, your GP will examine your throat and ask you some questions about your symptoms. They may take a swab of your throat to check if its caused by a viral or bacterial infection. It’ll usually take a few days to get your results.
If you develop severe tonsillitis as a teenager or adult, your GP may recommend a blood test for glandular fever.
There’s no specific treatment for tonsillitis. It usually gets better on its own within a week.
Always read the leaflet that comes with your medicine before taking it. Follow the recommended dosage instructions. If you’re not sure which treatments are suitable for you or your child, speak to a pharmacist for advice.
If test results show that your tonsillitis is caused by a bacterial infection, a short course of oral antibiotics may be prescribed.
If oral antibiotics do not help and your symptoms are getting worse, your GP may refer you to hospital for antibiotics to be given into a vein (IV antibiotics).
A small number of children and adults have tonsillitis for longer, or it keeps returning. This is called chronic tonsillitis and surgery may be needed.
Surgery to remove the tonsils (a tonsillectomy) is usually only recommended if:

you’ve had several severe episodes of tonsillitis over a long period of time
repeated episodes are disrupting normal activities

Most cases of tonsillitis are caused by a viral infection, such as cold or flu.
Some cases can also be caused by a bacterial infection, typically a strain of bacteria called group A streptococcus bacteria.
Tonsillitis itself isn’t contagious, but the infections that cause it are.
Complications of tonsillitis are rare and usually only occur if it’s caused by a bacterial infection. They’re usually the result of the infection spreading to another part of the body.
Possible complications of tonsillitis include:

quinsy (peritonsillar abscess) – an abscess (collection of pus) that develops between one of the tonsils and the wall of the throat
obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) – where the walls of the throat relax during sleep, which causes breathing difficulties and poor sleep

Other complications of tonsillitis are very rare. They usually only occur if an underlying bacterial infection is left untreated."
Tooth decay,"Tooth decay may not cause any pain. However, if you have dental caries you might have: 

toothache – either continuous pain keeping you awake or occasional sharp pain without an obvious cause
tooth sensitivity – you may feel tenderness or pain when eating or drinking something hot, cold or sweet
grey, brown or black spots appearing on your teeth
bad breath
an unpleasant taste in your mouth

Visit your dentist regularly, so early tooth decay can be treated as soon as possible and the prevention of decay can begin. Tooth decay is much easier and cheaper to treat in its early stages. Dentists can usually identify tooth decay and further problems with a simple examination or X-ray.
Find your nearest dentist
It’s also important to have regular dental check-ups. Adults should have a check-up at least once every 2 years and children under the age of 18 should have a check-up at least once a year.
Read more on getting over a fear of the dentist
Treatment of tooth decay depends on how advanced it is.
For early stage tooth decay – your dentist will talk to you about the amount of sugar in your diet and the times you eat. They may apply a fluoride gel, varnish or paste to the area. Fluoride helps to protect teeth by strengthening the enamel, making teeth more resistant to the acids from plaque that can cause tooth decay.
Your dentist may discuss a filling or crown with you. This involves removing the dental decay, offering local anaesthetic to numb the tooth and filling the hole.
If tooth decay has spread to the pulp (in the centre of the tooth, containing blood and nerves) – this may be removed in a process known as root canal treatment.
If the tooth is so badly damaged that it can’t be restored – it may need to be removed. Your dentist may be able to replace the tooth with a partial denture, bridge or implant.
NHS charges are set by the government and are standard for all NHS patients. Charges are assessed each year and usually change every April.
Some people don’t have to pay for dental treatment, including children, pregnant women and new mothers. Financial help may also be available to those on a low income.
The cost of private dental treatment varies between practices, as there is no set charge. If you choose to see a private dentist, make sure to agree the cost before having treatment.
Although tooth decay is a common problem, it’s often entirely preventable. The best way to avoid tooth decay is to keep your teeth and gums as healthy as possible. For example, you should:

visit your dentist regularly – your dentist will decide how often they need to see you based on the condition of your mouth, teeth and gums
cut down on sugary and starchy food and drinks, particularly between meals or within an hour of going to bed – some medications can also contain sugar, so it’s best to look for sugar-free alternatives where possible
look after your teeth and gums – brushing your teeth properly with a fluoride toothpaste twice a day, using floss and an interdental brush at least once a day
avoid smoking or drinking alcohol excessively – tobacco can interfere with saliva production, which helps to keep your teeth clean, and alcohol can contribute to the erosion of tooth enamel
see your dentist or GP if you have a persistently dry mouth – this may be caused by certain medicines, treatment or medical conditions

Read:

how to keep your teeth clean
reading food labels 

Establishing good eating habits by limiting sugary snacks and drinks can help your child avoid tooth decay. Regular visits to the dentist at an early age should also be encouraged.
It’s important to teach your child how to clean their teeth properly and regularly. Your dentist can show you how to do this. Younger children should use a children’s toothpaste, but make sure to read the label about how to use it. 
Children should still brush their teeth twice a day, especially before bedtime.
Your mouth is full of bacteria that form a film over the teeth called dental plaque.
When you consume food and drink high in carbohydrates – particularly sugary foods and drinks – the bacteria in plaque turn the carbohydrates into energy they need, producing acid at the same time.
If the plaque is allowed to build up, the acid can begin to break down (dissolve) the surface of your tooth, causing holes known as cavities.
Once cavities have formed in the enamel, the plaque and bacteria can reach the dentine (the softer, bone-like material underneath the enamel). As the dentine is softer than the enamel, the process of tooth decay speeds up.
Without treatment, bacteria will enter the pulp (the soft centre of the tooth that contains nerves and blood vessels). At this stage, your nerves will be exposed to bacteria, usually making your tooth painful.
The bacteria can cause a dental abscess in the pulp and the infection could spread into the bone, causing another type of abscess."
Toothache,
Tourette’s syndrome,
Transient ischaemic attack (TIA),"Like a stroke, the signs and symptoms of a TIA usually begin suddenly.
The main symptoms of stroke can be remembered with the word FAST.
FAST stands for:

Face – the face might drop on one side, the person may not be able to smile or their mouth may have dropped, and their eyelid may droop
Arms – the person may not be able to lift both arms and keep them there because of arm weakness or numbness in one arm
Speech – they might slur their speech or it might be garbled, or the person may not be able to talk at all despite appearing to be awake
Time – it’s time to phone 999 immediately if you see any of these signs or symptoms

It’s important to be aware of the symptoms of a stroke or TIA, especially if you live with or care for somebody in a high-risk group, like an elderly person or someone with diabetes or high blood pressure.
A person having a TIA or a stroke might not have all of these symptoms. If you notice any of these symptoms, you should consider a person may be having a stroke.
Symptoms in the FAST test identify most strokes and TIAs. TIAs sometimes cause different symptoms that appear suddenly, usually over a few seconds.
Other signs and symptoms may include:

complete paralysis of one side of the body
sudden loss or blurring of vision
dizziness
confusion
difficulty understanding what others are saying
problems with balance and co-ordination

However, there may be other causes for these symptoms.
During a TIA, it’s not possible to tell whether you’re having a TIA or a full stroke, so it’s important to phone 999 immediately. Even if the symptoms disappear, you should still have an urgent assessment by a health professional.
A TIA is a warning that you’re at risk of having a full stroke. An assessment can help doctors decide the best way to reduce the chances of this happening."
Transverse myelitis,"The symptoms of transverse myelitis can include:

muscle weakness in the legs, and sometimes the arms
mobility problems
unusual sensations and numbness
bladder problems
bowel problems
sexual problems
pain

Transverse myelitis can happen to anyone at any time in their life. In most cases there might only be one episode of symptoms, but sometimes it can happen repeatedly. Transverse myelitis can be the first sign of MS or another condition."
Trichomonas infection,"Most people with trichomonas infection will have no symptoms but they can still pass the infection on.
If you do develop symptoms you may get:

a yellow or green discharge from the vagina or penis, which can sometimes have an unpleasant smell
genital itching and soreness
pain or a burning sensation when peeing

Some women may get some pain or discomfort during sex.
If you think you might have trichomonas, get tested for free by:

booking an appointment at your local sexual health service
contacting your GP practice for an appointment

Testing is quick and straightforward. There are 2 main ways the sample can be collected:

using a swab – a small cotton bud is gently wiped over the area that might be infected, such as inside the vagina or penis
urine sample – this should ideally be done at least 1 or 2 hours after you last peed

Most sexual health clinics can look at the sample straightaway under the microscope and see the parasite. In some clinics and at your GP, the swab needs to be sent away to a lab to make the diagnosis.
The test is more accurate from vagina samples. It’s less accurate from penis and urine samples.
Trichomonas infection is treated with antibiotics.
It’s advised that both you and your partner(s) are treated if you have the infection.
You and your partner(s) may be asked to return to your GP practice or sexual health clinic for another test to check the infection has gone.
You should avoid having sex until 1 week after you and your partner(s) treatment has finished.
If your infection is untreated you may pass it on to other sexual partners.
Trichomonas infection is spread through unprotected sex and sharing sex toys.
It’s not passed on through oral or anal sex.
You can’t pass on trichomonas through:

kissing or hugging
sharing cups, plates or cutlery
toilet seats

The best way to reduce your risk of STIs is to practice safer sex. This means using a condom for vaginal, anal and oral sex.
If you have been diagnosed with trichomonas, you should get tested for all STIs including:

chlamydia
gonorrhoea
syphilis
"
Trigeminal neuralgia,"The main symptom of trigeminal neuralgia is sudden attacks of severe, sharp and shooting facial pain that last from a few seconds to about two minutes.
The pain is often described as an excruciating sensation, similar to an electric shock. The attacks can be so severe that you are unable to do anything during them, and the pain can sometimes bring you to your knees.
Trigeminal neuralgia usually only affects one side of your face. In rare cases it can affect both sides, although not at the same time. The pain can be in the teeth, the lower jaw, upper jaw, cheek and, less commonly, in the forehead or the eye.
You may feel aware of an impending attack of pain, though these usually come unexpectedly.
After the main, severe pain has subsided, you may experience a slight ache or burning feeling. There may also be a constant throbbing, aching or burning sensation between attacks.
You may have episodes of pain lasting regularly for days, weeks or months at a time. It is possible for the pain to then disappear completely and not recur for several months or years (a period known as “remission”). However, in severe cases, attacks may occur hundreds of times a day, and there may be no periods of remission.
Attacks of trigeminal neuralgia can be triggered by certain actions or movements, such as:

talking
smiling
chewing
brushing your teeth
washing your face
a light touch
shaving or putting on make-up
swallowing
kissing
a cool breeze or air conditioning
head movements
vibrations, such as walking or a car journey

However, pain can occur spontaneously with no triggers whatsoever.
Living with trigeminal neuralgia can be extremely difficult, and your quality of life can be significantly affected.
You may feel like avoiding activities such as washing, shaving or eating to avoid triggering pain, and the fear of pain may mean you avoid social activities. However, it’s important to try to live a normal life, and be aware that becoming undernourished or dehydrated can make the pain far worse.
The emotional strain of living with repeated episodes of pain can lead to psychological problems, such as depression. During periods of extreme pain, some people may even consider suicide. Even when pain-free, you may live in fear of the pain returning.
You should see your GP if you experience frequent or persistent facial pain, particularly if standard painkillers such as paracetamol and ibuprofen do not help and a dentist has ruled out any dental causes.
Your GP will try to identify the problem by asking about your symptoms and ruling out conditions that could be responsible for your pain. Trigeminal neuralgia can be a difficult condition to diagnose, so it’s important to try to describe your symptoms as accurately and in as much detail as possible.
Read more about diagnosing trigeminal neuralgia"
Tuberculosis (TB),"The symptoms of tuberculosis (TB) depend on where the infection occurs.
TB usually develops slowly. Your symptoms might not begin until months or even years after you were initially infected.
In some cases the infection doesn’t cause any symptoms, which is known as latent TB. It’s called active TB if you have symptoms. You should contact your GP if you or your child have symptoms of TB.
Read about the causes of tuberculosis for more information about latent and active TB.
General symptoms of TB include:

lack of appetite and weight loss
a high temperature (fever)
night sweats
extreme tiredness or fatigue

These symptoms can have many different causes, however, and are not always a sign of TB.
TB can also cause additional symptoms depending on which part of the body is infected.
Most infections affect the lungs, which can cause:

a persistent cough that lasts more than 3 weeks and usually brings up phlegm, which may be bloody
breathlessness that gradually gets worse

This is known as pulmonary TB.
Less commonly, TB infections develop in areas outside the lungs, such as the lymph nodes (small glands that form part of the immune system), the bones and joints, the digestive system, the bladder and reproductive system, and the nervous system (brain and nerves).
This is known as extrapulmonary TB.
Symptoms of extrapulmonary TB vary, but can include:

persistently swollen glands
abdominal (tummy) pain
pain and loss of movement in an affected bone or joint
confusion
a persistent headache
seizures (fits)

Extrapulmonary TB is more common in people with a weakened immune system, such as those with HIV."
Type 1 diabetes,"The symptoms of type 1 diabetes should disappear when you start taking insulin and you get the condition under control.
The main symptoms of diabetes are:

feeling very thirsty
urinating more frequently than usual, particularly at night
feeling very tired
weight loss and loss of muscle bulk
itchiness around the genital area, or regular bouts of thrush (a yeast infection)
blurred vision caused by the lens of your eye changing shape

Vomiting or heavy, deep breathing can also occur at a later stage. This is a dangerous sign and requires immediate admission to hospital for treatment.
You should seek urgent medical attention if you have diabetes and develop:

a loss of appetite
nausea or vomiting
a high temperature
stomach pain
fruity smelling breath – which may smell like pear drops or nail varnish (some people can smell this themselves)

If you have diabetes, your blood glucose levels can become very low. This is known as hypoglycaemia (or a “hypo”).
In most cases, hypoglycaemia occurs as a result of taking too much insulin, although it can also develop if you skip a meal, exercise very vigorously or drink alcohol on an empty stomach.
Symptoms of a “hypo” include:

feeling shaky and irritable
sweating
tingling lips
feeling weak
feeling confused
hunger
nausea (feeling sick)

A hypo can be brought under control simply by eating or drinking something sugary.
If it isn’t brought under control, a hypo can cause confusion, slurred speech and, eventually, unconsciousness.
In this case, an emergency injection of a hormone called glucagon will be needed. Glucagon increases the glucose in your blood. Your diabetes team will advise you in more detail about avoiding, recognising and treating a hypo.
As diabetes occurs as a result of your body being unable to produce any, or enough, insulin to regulate your blood glucose, your blood glucose levels may become very high. This happens because there’s insufficient insulin to move glucose out of your bloodstream and into your cells to produce energy.
If your blood glucose levels become too high, you may experience hyperglycaemia. The symptoms of hyperglycaemia are similar to the main symptoms of diabetes, but they may come on suddenly and be more severe. They include:

extreme thirst
a dry mouth
blurred vision
drowsiness
a need to pass urine frequently

Left untreated or if you already have an infection, hyperglycaemia can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis. This is a life-threatening condition, where the body breaks down fat and muscle as an alternative source of energy. This leads to a build-up of acids in your blood, which can cause vomiting, dehydration, unconsciousness and even death.
Your healthcare team will teach you about looking out for these symptoms and how to manage your ‘Sick Day’ rules.
The Diabetes UK website has more information about type 1 diabetes symptoms."
Type 2 diabetes,"The symptoms of diabetes occur because the lack of insulin means glucose stays in the blood and isn’t used as fuel for energy.
Your body tries to reduce blood glucose levels by getting rid of the excess glucose in your urine.
Typical symptoms include:

feeling very thirsty
passing urine more often than usual, particularly at night
feeling very tired
weight loss and loss of muscle bulk
slow to heal cuts or ulcers
frequent vaginal or penile thrush
blurred vision

Read more about the symptoms of type 2 diabetes
It’s very important for diabetes to be diagnosed as soon as possible as it will get progressively worse if left untreated."
Ulcerative colitis,"Some people may go for weeks or months with very mild symptoms, or none at all. This is known as remission. This may be followed by periods where the symptoms are particularly troublesome. These are known as flare-ups or relapses.
Symptoms of flare-ups vary from person-to-person. They may include:

diarrhoea 6 or more times a day
blood or mucus in your poo
severe abdominal pain
symptoms in other parts of your body

Severe ulcerative colitis can also cause symptoms like:

shortness of breath
a fast or irregular heartbeat
a high temperature (fever)
blood in your poo becoming more obvious
"
Underactive thyroid,"Many symptoms of an underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism) are the same as those of other conditions, so it can easily be confused for something else.
Symptoms usually develop slowly and you may not realise you have a medical problem for several years.
Common symptoms include:

tiredness
being sensitive to cold
weight gain
constipation
depression
slow movements and thoughts
muscle aches and weakness
muscle cramps
dry and scaly skin
brittle hair and nails
loss of libido (sex drive)
pain, numbness and a tingling sensation in the hand and fingers (carpal tunnel syndrome)
irregular periods or heavy periods

Elderly people with an underactive thyroid may develop memory problems and depression. Children may experience slower growth and development. Teenagers may start puberty earlier than normal.
If you have any of these symptoms, see your GP and ask to be tested for an underactive thyroid.
Read more about getting tested for an underactive thyroid
It’s unlikely that you’d have many of the later symptoms of an underactive thyroid, because the condition is often identified before more serious symptoms appear.
Later symptoms of an underactive thyroid include:

a low-pitched and hoarse voice
a puffy-looking face
thinned or partly missing eyebrows
a slow heart rate
hearing loss
anaemia
"
Urinary incontinence,
Urinary incontinence in women,
Urinary tract infection (UTI),"Infections of the bladder (cystitis) or urethra (tube that carries urine out of the body) are known as lower UTIs. These can cause: 

a need to pee more often than usual 
pain or discomfort when peeing 
sudden urges to pee 
feeling as though you’re unable to empty your bladder fully 
pain low down in your tummy 
urine that’s cloudy, foul-smelling or contains blood 
feeling generally unwell, achy and tired

You can speak to your pharmacist for advice and treatment on lower UTIs. 
Lower UTIs are common and aren’t usually a cause for major concern.  
Infections of the kidneys or ureters (tubes connecting the kidneys to the bladder) are known as upper UTIs. These can cause the same symptoms as lower UTIs and also: 

a high temperature (fever) of 38ºC (100.4ºF) or above 
pain in your sides or back 
shivering and chills 
feeling and being sick 
confusion 
agitation or restlessness 

Upper UTIs can be serious if left untreated, as they could damage the kidneys or spread to the bloodstream. 
Your GP team can: 

rule out other possible causes of your symptoms by testing a sample of your urine 
prescribe antibiotics if you have an infection 

In some people UTI symptoms do not go away. Short-term antibiotics do not work and urine tests do not show an infection.
This might mean you have a chronic (long-term) UTI. This can be caused by bacteria entering the lining of the bladder.
Because urine tests do not always pick up the infection and the symptoms can be similar to other conditions, chronic UTIs can be hard to diagnose.
Chronic UTIs might be treated with antibiotics that you take for a long time.
Chronic UTIs can have a big impact on your quality of life. If you have been treated for a UTI but you still have symptoms, speak to your GP about chronic UTIs and ask to be referred to a specialist.
UTIs are normally treated with a short term course of antibiotics.
Most women are given a 3-day course of antibiotic capsules or tablets. Men, pregnant women and people with more serious symptoms may need a slightly longer course. 
Your symptoms will normally pass within 3 to 5 days of starting treatment. Make sure you complete the whole course of antibiotics that you’ve been prescribed, even if you’re feeling better. 
Over-the-counter pain relief such as paracetamol can help with any pain. Drinking plenty of fluids may also help you feel better. 
Return to your GP if your symptoms don’t improve, get worse, or come back after treatment. "
Urinary tract infection (UTI) in children,
Urticaria (hives),
Vaginal cancer,
Vaginal discharge,
Varicose eczema,
Varicose veins,"Varicose veins are dark purple or blue in colour and are usually twisted and bulging in appearance. Some people with varicose veins may experience pain or discomfort.
As well as their distinctive appearance, symptoms of varicose veins can include:

aching, heavy and uncomfortable legs
swollen feet and ankles
burning or throbbing in your legs
muscle cramp in your legs, particularly at night
dry, itchy and thin skin over the affected vein

These symptoms are usually worse during warm weather or if you’ve been standing up for long periods of time. They may improve when you walk around or if you rest and raise your legs. Pillows are a good way to raise your legs comfortably.
Varicose veins usually develop on the legs, either on the back of your calf or on the inside of your leg. However, they can also sometimes occur in other parts of your body, such as your:

gullet (oesophagus)
womb (uterus)
vagina
pelvis
rectum (back passage)

If you are worried about the appearance of your veins, see your GP."
Venous leg ulcer,"Venous leg ulcers are open, often painful, sores in the skin that take more than a month to heal. They usually develop on the inside of the leg, just above the ankle.
If you have a venous leg ulcer, you may also have:

swollen ankles (oedema)
discolouration and darkening of the skin around the ulcer
hardened skin around the ulcer, which may make your leg feel hard or even resemble the shape of an upside-down champagne bottle
a heavy feeling in your legs
aching or swelling in your legs
red, flaky, scaly and itchy skin on your legs (varicose eczema)
swollen and enlarged veins on your legs (varicose veins)
an unpleasant and foul-smelling discharge from the ulcer

A venous leg ulcer can be susceptible to bacterial infection. Symptoms of an infected leg ulcer can include:

worsening pain
a green or unpleasant discharge coming from the ulcer
redness and swelling of the skin around the ulcer
a high temperature (fever)

Contact your GP if you think you’ve developed a venous leg ulcer. They’re unlikely to get better on their own, as they usually require specialist medical treatment.
You should also contact your GP or leg ulcer specialist if you’ve been diagnosed with a venous leg ulcer and have symptoms that suggest it could be infected.

Vertigo,
Vitamin B12 or folate deficiency anaemia,"Vitamin B12 and folate perform several important functions in the body, including keeping the nervous system healthy.
A deficiency in either of these vitamins can cause a wide range of problems, including:

extreme tiredness
a lack of energy
pins and needles (paraesthesia)
a sore and red tongue
mouth ulcers
muscle weakness
disturbed vision
psychological problems, which may include depression and confusion 
problems with memory, understanding and judgement

Some of these problems can also occur if you have a deficiency in vitamin B12 or folate, but don’t have anaemia.
Read about the symptoms of vitamin B12 or folate deficiency anaemia
See your GP if you think you may have a vitamin B12 or folate deficiency. These conditions can often be diagnosed based on your symptoms and the results of a blood test.
It’s important for vitamin B12 or folate deficiency anaemia to be diagnosed and treated as soon as possible because, although many of the symptoms improve with treatment, some problems caused by the condition can be irreversible.

Vomiting in adults,
Vomiting in children and babies,
Vulval cancer,"Symptoms of vulval cancer can include:

a persistent itch in the vulva
pain, soreness or tenderness in the vulva
raised and thickened patches of skin that can be red, white or dark
a lump or wart-like growth on the vulva
bleeding from the vulva or blood-stained vaginal discharge between periods
an open sore in the vulva
a burning pain when passing urine
a mole on the vulva that changes shape or colour

Speak to your GP if you notice any changes in the usual appearance of your vulva. While it’s highly unlikely to be the result of cancer, these changes should be investigated.
Read more about diagnosing vulval cancer.
The exact cause of vulval cancer is unclear, but your risk of developing the condition is increased by the following factors:

increasing age
vulval intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN) – where the cells in the vulva are abnormal and at risk of turning cancerous
persistent infection with certain versions of the human papilloma virus (HPV)
skin conditions affecting the vulva, such as lichen sclerosus
smoking

You may be able to reduce your risk of vulval cancer by stopping smoking and taking steps to reduce the chances of picking up an HPV infection.
Read more about the causes of vulval cancer.
The main treatment for vulval cancer is surgery to remove the cancerous tissue from the vulva and any lymph nodes containing cancerous cells.
Some people may also have radiotherapy (where radiation is used to destroy cancer cells) or chemotherapy (where medication is used to kill cancer cells), or both.
Radiotherapy and chemotherapy may be used without surgery if you’re not well enough to have an operation, or if the cancer has spread and it isn’t possible to remove it all.
Read more about treating vulval cancer.
It’s not thought to be possible to prevent vulval cancer completely, but you may be able to reduce your risk by:

practising safer sex – using a condom during sex can offer some protection against HPV
attending cervical screening appointments – cervical screening can detect HPV and pre-cancerous conditions such as VIN
stopping smoking

The HPV vaccination may also reduce your chances of developing vulval cancer. This is offered to all girls who are 12 to 13 years old as part of their routine childhood immunisation programme."
Warts and verrucas,
Whiplash,
Whooping cough,"The first symptoms of whooping cough are similar to those of a cold, such as a runny nose, red and watery eyes, a sore throat, and a slightly raised temperature.
Intense coughing bouts start about a week later.
The bouts usually last a few minutes at a time and tend to be more common at night.
Coughing usually brings up thick mucus and may be followed by vomiting.
Between coughs, you or your child may gasp for breath – this may cause a ‘whoop’ sound, although not everyone has this.
The strain of coughing can cause the face to become very red, and there may be some slight bleeding under the skin or in the eyes.
Young children’s skin can sometimes briefly turn dusky, blue (cyanosis) if they have trouble breathing.
In very young babies, the cough may not be particularly noticeable, but there may be brief periods where they stop breathing.
The bouts will eventually start to become less severe and less frequent over time, but it may be a few months before they stop completely.
Whooping cough can affect people of any age, including:

babies and young children – young babies under 6 months of age are at a particularly increased risk of complications of whooping cough
older children and adults – it tends to be less serious in these cases, but can still be unpleasant and frustrating
people who’ve had whooping cough before – you’re not immune to whooping cough if you’ve had it before, although it tends to be less severe the second time around
people vaccinated against whooping cough as a child – protection from the whooping cough vaccine tends to wear off after a few years

You can get whooping cough if you come into close contact with someone with the infection.
A person with whooping cough is infectious from about 6 days after they were infected – when they just have cold-like symptoms – until three weeks after the coughing bouts start.
Antibiotic treatment can reduce the length of time someone is infectious.
Treatment for whooping cough depends on your age and how long you’ve had the infection.
Children under 6 months who are very ill and people with severe symptoms will usually be admitted to hospital for treatment.
People diagnosed during the first 3 weeks of infection may be prescribed antibiotics to take at home. These will help stop the infection spreading to others, but may not reduce the symptoms.
People who’ve had whooping cough for more than 3 weeks won’t normally need any specific treatment, as they’re no longer contagious and antibiotics are unlikely to help.
While you’re recovering at home, it can help to get plenty of rest, drink lots of fluids, clean away mucus and sick from your or your child’s mouth, and take painkillers such as paracetamol or ibuprofen for a fever.
Avoid using cough medicines, as they’re not suitable for young children and are unlikely to be of much help.
If you or your child are taking antibiotics for whooping cough, you need to be careful not to spread the infection to others.
Other members of your household may also be given antibiotics and a dose of the whooping cough vaccine to stop them becoming infected.
There are 3 routine vaccinations that can protect babies and children from whooping cough:

the whooping cough vaccine in pregnancy – this can protect your baby during the first few weeks of life; the best time to have it is soon after the 16th week of your pregnancy
the 6-in-1 vaccine – offered to babies at 8, 12 and 16 weeks of age
the 4-in-1 pre-school booster – offered to children by 3 years and 4 months

These vaccines don’t offer lifelong protection from whooping cough, but they can help stop children getting it when they’re young and more vulnerable to the effects of the infection.
Older children and adults aren’t routinely vaccinated, except during pregnancy or a whooping cough outbreak.
Babies and young children under 6 months are usually most severely affected by whooping cough.
They’re at an increased risk of:

dehydration
breathing difficulties
weight loss
pneumonia – an infection of the lungs
fits (seizures)
kidney problems
brain damage caused by a lack of oxygen reaching the brain
death – although this is very rare

Older children and adults tend to be less severely affected, although they may experience problems caused by repeated coughing, such as nosebleeds, bruised ribs or a hernia."
Wilms’ tumour,
Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome,
Womb (uterus) cancer,"The most common symptom of womb cancer is abnormal bleeding from the vagina, although most people with abnormal bleeding don’t have cancer.
Bleeding may start as light bleeding accompanied by a watery discharge, which may get heavier over time. Most women and anyone with a womb diagnosed with womb cancer have been through the menopause, so any vaginal bleeding will be unusual.
In women and anyone with a womb who hasn’t been through the menopause, unusual vaginal bleeding may consist of:

periods that are heavier than usual
vaginal bleeding in between normal periods

Less common symptoms include pain in the lower abdomen (tummy) and pain during sex.
If womb cancer reaches a more advanced stage, it may cause additional symptoms. These include:

pain in the back, legs, or pelvis
loss of appetite
tiredness
nausea

If you have postmenopausal vaginal bleeding, or notice a change in the normal pattern of your period, visit your GP.
Only 1 in 10 cases of unusual vaginal bleeding after the menopause are caused by womb cancer, so it’s unlikely your symptoms will be caused by this condition.
However, if you have unusual vaginal bleeding, it’s important to get the cause of your symptoms investigated. The bleeding may be the result of a number of other potentially serious health conditions, such as:

endometriosis – where tissue that behaves like the lining of the womb is found on the outside of the womb
fibroids – non-cancerous growths that can develop inside the uterus
polyps in the womb lining

Other types of gynaecological cancer can also cause unusual vaginal bleeding, particularly cervical cancer.

Yellow fever,
Zika virus,"Most people don’t have any symptoms when they are infected with Zika virus. If symptoms do occur, they are usually mild and start 3 to 14 days after the infection has been caught. Symptoms last around 2 to 7 days.
Commonly reported symptoms include:

rash
itching all over the body
fever
headache
joint pain (with possible swelling, mainly in the smaller joints of the hands and feet)
muscle pain
conjunctivitis (red eyes)
lower back pain
pain behind the eyes

There is no specific treatment for the symptoms of Zika virus.
Drinking plenty of water and taking paracetamol may help to relieve symptoms.
Zika virus is mainly spread by mosquito bites. Unlike the mosquitoes that spread malaria, this type of mosquito mainly bites during the day from sunrise to sunset.
If a woman is infected when she is pregnant, the virus can spread to the baby and may cause harm. This is called ‘Congential Zika Syndrome’.
Less commonly, Zika virus can be spread from:

a person with the infection to another during unprotected sex
through blood transfusions or organ transplants

If you are planning international travel you can use this A to Z guide to check if your destination has Zika virus.
There is no vaccine or medicine to prevent Zika virus infection.
In a country with a risk of Zika virus, you can reduce your risk of catching the virus by avoiding mosquito bites.
Pregnant women should avoid or postpone non-essential travel to areas with a risk of Zika virus transmission.
If you are going abroad, you can get information on the risk of Zika virus and detailed travel advice on the fitfortravel website.
Further information about travel health and vaccinations.
Avoiding mosquito bites is one of the best ways to reduce your risk of Zika virus infection.
The most effective bite prevention methods should be used during daytime and night-time hours.
There are some steps you can take to avoid mosquito bites.
The most effective repellents contain 50% diethyltoluamide (DEET). These can be used by pregnant or breastfeeding women.
Further information on mosquito bite prevention is available from the fitfortravel website.
Zika virus infection in pregnant women is a cause of birth defects in the baby, including microcephaly (abnormally small head). This can be associated with abnormal brain development. It is also known as congenital Zika syndrome.
Zika virus infection can also cause pregnancy complications, including stillbirth or premature delivery.
If travel is unavoidable, there are actions you can take to help avoid infection.
Your midwife or hospital doctor will discuss the risk with you and advise whether you need any additional tests.
If you are trying to get pregnant, discuss your travel plans with your GP, practice nurse or travel clinic.
It is recommended that women avoid unprotected sex and starting a pregnancy while travelling in an area with Zika virus. You should also avoid unprotected sex and starting a pregnancy for 8 weeks (if a woman) or 3 months (if a man) after you return home.
Speak to your midwife or doctor for advice if you’re worried that your unborn baby may be affected by Zika virus. If you are still concerned after receiving assurances you can ask for counselling. Counselling can also be offered if you feel more stressed or anxious than usual.
You should wait 28 days to donate blood after travelling to an area with Zika virus. These guidelines are set out by the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service.
If you want to know whether any recent foreign travel temporarily prevents you from giving blood, visit the Scotblood website. You can also call their National Contact Centre on 0345 90 90 999.
Zika virus is a cause of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), a serious condition of the nervous system.
The risk of developing GBS following a Zika virus infection is very low.
If you have had Zika virus, your clinical team may give your details to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS).
This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time.
Find out more about the register."
